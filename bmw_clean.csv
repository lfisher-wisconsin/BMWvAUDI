Relatively decent handling for the type car, and just the right size and height.  We stayed away from the newer version to avoid a Mini based front wheel platform derived car as opposed to a BMW based one.  The new 2018 X1 also features a flimsy cloth covering under the moonroof that I can see ripping quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         If you want a X1 like this may I suggest springing for the upgraded interior.  Base level seating has poor lateral support and are unacceptable.  Base halogen headlights are unacceptable and should be avoided.  My 3 series coupe has xenons which are ""light years"" better.  Sorry!:-)  Base sound system is ""media-ocre"" at best.  I don't understand the need for moonroofs on BMWs, and wish they would apportion the monies elsewhere and delete them.  Acceleration with the 240 hp is considerably better than you would expect for a 4 cyl.  It feels like a 6!  Braking is only adequate , but some experts blame this on the stock tires rather than the car.  I also would like a manual transmission X1 like they have in other countries!  When you're shopping, seek out a well optioned example only!  A base car sporting only a badge is bad form indeed.",3,2014," BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

Great handling car with aggressive sporty ride, coming from a V6 engine it was hard to believe this car was only equipped with turbo 4. Comes with just enough tech to be comfortable (I never cared for Lane Departure Assistance, Front Collision Warning, and other new safety features). It however came with the crappiest quality materials I have seen in German cars, and it because the hard plastics were constantly expanding and rubbing, rattles/creaks were always present. The run flats combined with M suspension did not help either. Oh, and I purchased this vehicle at 45k and 2 years later the value was at 14k so its two year depreciation was @ 68% which is a little steep even for a BMW.",4,2014," BMW X1 SUV sDrive28i 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

BMW felt it was safe enough for me to drive but not take in trade, ""they also have a stop sale on any affected models"". I contacted BMW and asked for and got a rental car. The dealer now has my BMW and at this point I have doubts about if and when I will ever see it again and I'm sure I will take a beating when I trade or sell it if and when I do.  Do yourself a favor go to safercar.gov and check the vehicle ID number of ANY CAR you have or are looking to buy to check for open recalls!  Avoid any car with a TAKADA airbag open recall like the plague.

I downsized from my 2005 X5 which I loved and miss very much (had 160k miles and never a major repair or problem).  I've always been happy with BMW's.  I've owned 7, 5, 3 and X series throughout the last 20 or so years.  The reason I down sized is because I'm a commuter and was looking for something that can give me 30mpg on the hwy.  It was the BMW or Subaru.  I've also enjoyed Subaru's and nowadays these are my only two choices of go to vehicles for cars as a daily driver.  I'm a car enthusiast and have owned Ferrari, Mercedes, Lexus and plenty other luxury and sports cars.  I'm not posting to brag I'm posting so the reader knows I have choices and know about many cars from first hand driving experience.  This X1 is great in handling around town.  I got this due to it's looks, compact size for ease of downtown parking, cargo area for placing travel bags, groceries and 60/40 split that I can slide in my surfboard.  The only reason I didn't choose the Subaru is I really don't visit the snow that much.  But if you get the X1 in the xDrive it'll be a very close match.  I got the sDrive because it feels more like driving a sports car with that real wheel power and cutting in tight corners when I punch it around the twisties and I like that feeling.  Go for the Ultimate Package as it'll include many features like Navigation, Rear Camera and Parking Distance Control.What I miss is having that extra space or elbow room when I have passengers and sitting much higher up (comparing with my old X5).  What I love better is the newer electronics and fuel efficiency and having the Ultimate Package amenities. If you're looking into a used X1 then go with 2014 or 2015 model years.  2013 was the first year this model hit the US and the 2016 has been completely redesigned in and out.  The deals are on the 2014 for all the lease returns that hit and chances are you'll still get the 4 year/50k miles free maintenance plan that's remaining and Certified Pre-Owned near bumper to bumper warranty if you buy it from a BMW dealer.

The seats are cheap and not comfortable for a long drive.  The acceleration is more like a Ford Escort than a BMW.  The sales guy said it is because it is a 4 cylinder.  No excuse.  The BMW engineers should be ashamed of what they created.  The navigation is ok, but feels more like my 2004 Infiniti G35 than a 2014.  The steering and suspension are stiff.  This is good for me.  It's very loud on the road.  You hear everything.  The tires wear down very quickly.  The dealer was telling me to replace them at around 13,000 miles.  Ridiculous.  Anyone, besides my kids, who gets into the car has a little trouble, no matter how I position the passenger seat. I've taken the car to the dealer a dozen times over the past 2 years for different problems (wiper blades not contacting windshield, bluetooth wouldn't connect, valve cover leaking oil onto intake manifold, and the list goes on).  Thankfully, I only have one year left on my lease.  It kills me to have to drive this car for that long, but it's the commitment/mistake I made.  I feel like I got taken by the BMW logo.

The outback was $13K less based on MSRP but the X1 leased for $150 less per ($330 per month with nothing down but an old Escape with 130K miles).

It has the chassis and handling dynamics from the previous generation E90/E91 platform that's one of the best handling 3 series. It has hydraulic steering instead of BMW's new vague, imprecise electric steering. Those are combined with the most recent, excellent drive train.

Then my commute changed and was taking 2 busy highways for 45 minutes.  I felt very insecure in my little car.  I really like driving a car, so although I wanted a higher vehicle, I didn't look forward to the parking issues of having a bigger vehicle.  Then I came across the X1.  It is actually 6"" shorter than my coupe was and not much wider.  However, it has the height I wanted, and great interior and cargo space!  Just blown away!  When I test drove it, I immediately felt comfortable with the location of all the controls.  I am only 5'4"" and everything is easily reached.  I've always really liked the controls to be in the gear shift area and using a dial.  Someone commented it isn't safe to look down.  You aren't supposed to look at it at all.  That is the point of it being down there, so you can adjust things by touch instead of by sight.  You just need to learn where the buttons are and how to use the dial effectively.  The visibility is great and since I don't have any depth perception, I LOVE the parking help.  Now I can go around tight spaces without worrying about hitting something.  There are 2 negatives only, the rear window is small and blocked by the rear center head rest.  I'll just fold down the center to improve viewing.  Also, the seat is very firm.  I'll have to bring a seat pad for long trips.  For a daily driver with lots of stop and go traffic, I am ecstatic.  It is great looking and fun to drive.  ***update after driving for a month.

In the areas that are priorities to me - safety, quality, performance - the X1 scores well.  Its chief limitations are modest cargo capacity and a somewhat cramped (for adults at least) rear seat.  However, given that the X1 has a footprint barely bigger than a Prius, it is roomy by the standards of small vehicles.  If you need substantial cargo capacity you should look at the X3 or X5.  If you need to seat adults in the rear seats on a regular basis look at the X3 or ensure that you get an X1 with the sliding/reclining rear seat option.  But for my family only small children sit in the back, and the standard X1 is just about ideal.  We have a second car which is a good deal larger than the X1.  Parking tends to be difficult where we live, and it is significantly easier to find a parking place for the X1 than it is to find a parking place for the larger vehicle.  Fuel economy is noteworthy, I did not believe the stated 32mpg on the highway was really achievable, but we took a road trip with the X1 and I can report that figure is absolutely attainable.  Overall great small SUV.",5,2016," BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

I expected this new generation of X1 to be fair since it was being molded to look like the rest of the X-line family (truth be told, I wanted the Tesla Model 3 but couldn't wait that long). I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is actually more fun than the last one. Slightly less horsepower, yet the 0-60 is quicker. The move to a front-wheel-emphasized 4WD is not noticeable. I sometimes miss the hydraulic steering (however, the 2016's adaptive steering makes parking and city driving much easier). I got every tech package except the ACC (c'mon, an extra thousand, really?) and it seems worth it. By adding a few extra PSI to the tires (compared to the door sticker), I am getting 35+ MPG on the highway! Eco-mode is much more useful now without sacrifice (I especially didn't like the jolt on the 2014 when I needed to pass someone on the highway due to the shift timing change in this mode). The interior materials are a step up (interior lighting at night is especially top notch). The rear view is crowded compared to previous gen (due to smaller rear window and seat back obstructions), but not dangerous. The front seats are narrower than the last model and could use a little more cushioning as well - make sure you like them first vs. ordering the sports seats/package. I am 5'8 at 175 pounds so the base seats work for me. Overall, It's more luxurious, quieter and more fun than the previous generation (which was already great).

My favorite attributes about BMW is the familiarity with the iDrive system and it's the only manufacturer in this segment where the passenger can enter an address into the Nav while the car is in drive.  I test drove Lexus/Audi and both required the car to be in park in order to enter an address into the nav (unless I wanted to use the voice recognition - which is always terrible)!  Anyway, this car is typical BMW - high end interior parts and all of the controls are where they should be.

I'm 6'4"" 235lbs and can fit comfortably in any of the seats even with the front seat in the rearmost position.  It's been comfortable on several interstate trips and we love the zippy handling and performance around town.

She's officially a ""car girl"" now! :-)We just recently hit 50,000 miles and the car has been flawless. We’re sad to see the included scheduled maintenance expire, but the only thing it’s had to cover so far is some font brake pads and oil/fluid changes.  We also had to buy a set of tires.

The headroom and legroom are comparable or even bigger than the current Q5, GLC, X3, and GTI. It’s even comparable to the larger X5.

I understand it’s being categorized as a subcompact SUV/SAV, but you really have to test drive and get inside of the car to understand what I’m talking about. It’s BIG!!! OK, now the bad. The front seat is too narrow. The gas pedal is too close to the side wall of the center console. The center console storage is relatively small. There is still noticeable turbo lag when stop and go.

BMW must be paying for positive reviews, because it' not that stellar of a vehicle. The car has stylish looks, has many bells and whistles, and is fun to drive in Sport mode, but that's about it - everything else is like driving a typical 4-cylinder, kind of boring and sluggish. The worst part about the X1 is the interior comfort and design. The front seats are the worst I've ever seen, they have ZERO padding, way too firm like sitting on a park bench, they're also too narrow and high. The leather is very grippy and not smooth, tugs your shirt. The steering wheel obstructs the dashboard, you can't get a clear view of the entire instrumentation through the top hole of the steering wheel. The controls for the screen and navigation are horrible and feel 20 years old. Selecting single letters or digits to input an address into the nav? Forget it. It's also unsafe having to look down at the control wheel and buttons instead of up. I would not describe the whole system as intuitive at all. Outside temp only visible to the driver, no digital speedometer, annoying. The on-wheel radio controls are not the easiest to set up or navigate. The whole cabin instrumentation is just overcomplicated, and kind of Frankensteined with new and old. The screen looks like it should descend, but it doesn't, it's kind of unsightly like it's tacked on. MPG is so-so unless you drive in Eco mode which turns engine off at stops.

Once home I noticed the front grill was missing.  I was told my BMW had navigation that talks, but it didn't.  I was told it had blind spot monitoring, but it didn't, this car has a serious blind spot.  The dealer wrote a ""We Owe"" to fix the dash.  Trying to get BMW to do anything is like pulling teeth.  2 months later ding is still there and no light.  Their response is, it's coming from Germany and we have to get approval.  Just make sure your X1 is in perfect condition when you leave, because it will never get fixed.  Sad to say this will be my last BMW because of the service I've received.  UPDATE:  Finally after contacting Better Business Bureau, Fields BMW replaced the dash and the light in the door.  It was also missing the front grill cover and they replaced it too.  This was a nightmare getting it done and I had to contact: BBB, BMW and every social media available.  It took me over 100 phone calls, most of which didn't get returned, to get the car in new condition.

Navigation - slow to acquire satellites and then 5 minutes later will alter your route based on traffic, this is sometimes too late to take a better route. My phone is much better. Also, if you decide to go a different route the system will keep trying to reroute you back to the original rather than recalculating. Once I went 70 miles and passed into the upper in Michigan before it recalculated. I was recently sent a notice that I could upgrade to current maps for $59 annually. This is pretty funny. 2.

My particular x1 is a loaded M Sport 35i -- don't think there's anything it hasn't got.  It's real comfortable inside -- I'm 6'1"" and find the front seat roomy.  The controls are easy to use and the infotainment system I like much better than the one on the Corvette -- shorter learning curve, more intuitive.  I have no idea what the mileage is and don't care, really.  Whatever they say it is, I'm sure mine is much less because of the way I drive.  I did try the eco-boost thing and it does improve mileage -- there's a little readout that tell you how much, but, when it's on, the car doesn't drive like a BMW.  I think it's good for long highway trips when you're just going along at the speed limit for hours, but when you're actually driving the car, forget it.  You don't buy a car like this to save on gas.  For that, get a Prius.  So, bottom line, I am totally sold on this car.  I hate the fact that, for 2016, BMW ruined it, making it front wheel drive and sticking you with the smaller engine and the eight speed transmission, but, hey, I got the sweet spot, seems like and I will keep this car for a very long time.Update 8/3/17 Everything above is still true.  I'm always thinking about cars, but there is just no way I could sell this BMW.  I took it for a road trip earlier this year and it was great on a long drive, comfortable and, for me, the absolutely perfect size.  Looks like I'm stuck with it.  By the way, these cars are very hard to find.  I friend of mine wants one just like it and we looked regionally and, tricked out like mine, didn't find one.Update 2/3/18Same old story.  I'm buying an extended warranty to 100K on this baby.  I keep looking at stuff and don't see anything that matches it, so, since I've only got a two car garage, when I get to the place where I just can't resist the new car itch any longer, the C7 will have to go.  I love it, but I love this BMR more.  On the VW, I did finally get a few K from them.  I still took a loss and will never even look at a VW again, but something is better than nothing, as the say.Update 8/4/18No changes except for new tires.

What it strikes me as is a 3 Series of 2 generations ago, re-imagined as a sport hatchback.  I've had mine for a couple months and I really couldn't be happier with my decision.  Mine is loaded: Ultimate package, X-Line package, Adaptive Xenon Lighting package, Cold-weather package, etc. but I bought it as a dealer demo with 6,800 miles on it so it was about $8,000 or so below sticker.  We are empty-nesters and my wife has a Ford Explorer so I really could have gotten by with a smaller sport sedan or even a coupe (I test drove both).  However, I am a cyclist and backpacker so having a bit more utility in the vehicle I drive every day kind of put the X-1 over the top for me.  Plus the price was lower than a 3 series or a 228i AND I really don't feel like I gave up much in the way of driving dynamics.  With 240hp and 260 lb/ft of torque, there is simply gobs of power on tap in this 3,500 lb car.  I got the rwd version (we don't get much snow if any) so it handles like a true German sports sedan.  It's shorter (nose-to-tail), narrower and lighter than the 3 Series wagon and it's like 9 inches shorter (in height) than the X3 so it really is more of a hatchback than a wagon or SUV.  I also like that it has 7"" of ground clearance: not enough to introduce too much lean in the corners, but enough to not have to worry about hitting curbs and parking barriers in parking lots.  It's a very nice touring car on your favorite 2 lane hwy (or even the interstate) and it scoots around town or back roads as zippy as you want to.  It has plenty of headroom in front and back.  Negatives?  Leg room in the back is a bit tight for adults, only 2 will comfortably ride in the back (due to the transmission tunnel), and there's a bit too much wind and road noise on the interstate for a BMW (in my opinion--having owned BMWs before).  All of that I can live with because the virtues of this car far outweigh the negatives.",4,2015," BMW X1 SUV sDrive28i 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

(This may not be true with the new X1 that's on the Mini chassis.)

Not really for a large family of large people, but for our purposes, occasionally carrying four normal size adults, it's perfect. All that said, we stretched our budget for a well optioned car with a sticker of $49,500 and we love it. Downside: It came with run-flat tires, unrepairable, harder-riding and expensive to replace.

I'm a guy who likes to get pushed back in my seat when I step on the gas, so I'm always looking for a way to balance that need with fuel use.  The Subaru's 6 gave me the acceleration I want and generally I loved the Outback but found the fuel economy very disappointing.  I live in Brooklyn, NY - so just think traffic that is about as tough on fuel economy as you get.  So at the end of my lease, I test drove an X1 figuring that the turbo 4 gave me a chance to have my cake (acceleration) and eat it too (decent gas mileage).  That theory is paying off so far.  The X1 is quick and nimble - probably a half second faster - to 60 than the 3.6R and my gas mileage is averaging about 4 - 5 mpg better and much better on the highway.  I drove the car on a 1300 mile trip down the east coast and back and averaged just about 30 mpg (80 mile per hour on cruise control most of the way). The Outback never approached that kind of fuel efficiency.  The Outback did have more room in the cabin especially for the rear seat passengers (my now grown kids are complaining about comfort on longer trips).  The 3.6R also had a smoother ride over bumpy roads as the X1's stiffness and added sportiness comes at the cost of a smooth ride.  But the slightly smaller length and width of the X1 is a big benefit when parking - especially on the street.  I think for me the X1 beats the Outback in most of the other categories that matter to me - aesthetics too.  My only other beefs would be the bluetooth entertainment system and the driver memory settings (it can supposedly store at least 2).  To this day we can't figure out why the bluetooth bounces between mine and my wife's phone when we are both in the car and we prefer using waze on our phones to the navigation that comes with the X1 - so with bluetooth connection - consistency matters.  It also is irritating that if your phone is connected wirelessly and then you decide to connect it to the usb - the car disconnects and you have to reconnect.  Finally - For some reason the car keeps losing my settings when I select them - so I'm planning on going back to the dealership to see what's up with that.  I'm a pretty picky person, so I don't want the gripes to make readers think I'm not happy with the car - overall it's one of the best car's I've owned and a very good value for the dough.",4,2017," BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

Positive comments include terrific pick up, unencumbered interior, a nice tight turning radius, a huge panoramic moon roof [option], bold styling ,outstanding heater/air conditioning and a good value for a new Beemer. As well, if living in a colder climate, DO spring for the heated front seats and steering wheel. They are worth every penny. Lastly, in 2017 many options were standalone so the cost was individualized, not part of a more expensive package.Needed improvements include 1.MUCH more comfortable front seats. Our options included sport seats after reading the consumer reviews, which were right on. Even the sport seats are narrow and very firm. We have had 5 other Beemers and never had an issue with the seat comfort. 2. Considerable road noise. We have 19"" upgraded tires[run flat] and they might contribute to the level of noise. 3. BE CAREFUL!! The 'sliding rear seat' option does provide for more cargo room[ about 4 ""] but since the regular position of the rear seat without the option almost abuts the rear wheel well already, you only gain about an inch of additional rear legroom by paying for this option. It's simply not worth it unless additional cargo room is a priority. I am 6' 3"" and need to move the front seat all the way back, leaving a tight area for legroom behind my driver's seat. BMW did curtail their warranty so be advised that items covered in the past now cost the consumer[e.g. windshield wipers replacement during scheduled service- standard in the past... over $30.00 EACH now] The length of the warranty has been modified as well.   UPDATE.....The X1 is built in Germany, unlike the X3 and 5. I took a sleighride with our X1 this past winter and quickly discovered that the Potenza tires were exclusively SUMMER tires . Be advised that I believe Germany does not recognize all season tires- only summer or winter. I was informed that winter tires are required and cars without them can be ticketed in Germany. SO....IF that is accurate, since we ordered our car from Germany in April, it came equipped with summer tires. We will be switching to all season within the next year. Lastly, the Potenza tires, while enabling the car to maneuver well does not appear to wear well.

Good visibility all the way around.This X1 is fully loaded, but a blind spot monitor was not available at any cost. It must be the only BMW without that option. Why? I think the BSP is a great option, it has saved me a couple of times from cutting somebody off or even an accident that would have been my fault. My wife drives the car mostly, and she loves it. Small enough so that she can park and maneuver around things fairly easily, but large enough to feel like you have some metal between you and the other idiots who drive so nutsy on our local roads. I find the interior of the X1 a little inferior in quality materials from other BMW's, still good stuff, but somehow it seems a little weak for a BMW. The technology and especially the layout of the interior is the best there is, anywhere. We test drove the Audi Q3, Lexus NX, BMW was a clear winner over these two comparable models.

Our '15 was 12K miles over the agreement and BMW let us out of the lease early and forgave the extra miles, so it was the best path.  The '17 X1 is a different car then the '15 model year.  The seats are smaller/shorter and are not as comfortable for me, a 5'10"", 150# male, but for my wife, a petite 5'1"" 110# female they are great.  She likes the seating position more than the '15 X1.  IMO, the interior is cheaper than before.  For example, the shifter is a simpler analog type vs. the electric fly by wire on the '15 model.  The buttons and switches, while still of high quality are noticeably different in feel.  Our model has the iDrive knob/buttons in the center console, no nav, and is OK, but a distraction, IMO.  To the positive, the turbo charged engine has plenty of power, and brakes are good.  I really like the LED headlights, they put out a nice bright white light.  The cabin noise is about the same as the '15, and is I believe, affected by the OEM tires used by the factory.  Overall, BMW says this is the lowest cost Bimmer, and on this count they are right, they accomplish this feat by using cheaper components.  We have been a BMW family for 15+ years owning 7s, Z3, Z4, 535i, X3 (still owned and going strong with 118K on the odometer) and 2 X1s, so I am a bit conflicted that they are producing such entry level cars.

I bought it to replace my 2015 Ford Escape which itself is a great compact SUV. I saw a 2015 X1 and thought I'd give it a look. My impression was cheaply made, way too small, and WAY overpriced.

I love the ability to use the eco mode when driving on the longer stretches of road. I have been getting 32 mpg on my normal commute. And when I shift to the sport mode, there is plenty of fun power when I want it. Its not a sedan or coupe, its a compact SUV, but it is fun to drive. A few little complaints, like the fact that the cup holders hold maybe a sippee cup and  there is no digital speedometer or compass on the base model, the Bluetooth seems to lag a little when using Waze or Google maps, and the A/C seems to want to run even when I turn it off.

We were about to settle on the Hyundai (even though it didn't drive especially well) when the night before I read an article about the X1 and figured we'll go check it out before settling on the Hyundai. To our delight, we loved the way the X1 looked, drove, and its interior is bigger than it seems from the outside. The trunk was the biggest surprise to us with the underneath compartment. We loved the car. We compromised on the base X-Drive model MSRP of $36K but got them down to $33K. We took it home that night and have been enjoying it ever since. Nearly 1 month later, we have gotten a good feel for the X1. Our biggest complaints have to do with some basic features lacking in the base model which we knew going in. The fully loaded Hyundai had all the features I'm talking about i.e. LED Headlights, XM Radio, Blind Spot monitoring, Sunroof, backup camera, adaptive cruise, forward collision warning, integrated sunshades, heated seats, navigation to name some big ones. The X1 does have some of these features if you elect certain packages but the price will quickly climb into the 40's and beyond. Ultimately, we chose the BMW because it drove 100 times better than the Hyundai and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress up a Hyundai it is still a Hyundai and drives as such. We've been averaging 25MPG combined which is better than all the other vehicles we tried especially with an all-wheel drive. Besides our lack of options our only other complaint really is the suspension. As expert reviewers have stated, the X1's suspension is very stiff and you feel it when you go over speed bumps or bumps in the road. But I still prefer the stiffness over the squishyness of the Hyundai's body roll suspension. Another weird thing our X1 lacks is the ability to control the rear dome light from the rear. It's an odd design flaw but we'll get over it. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our decision.",4,2017," BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"
"91",2016-11-19,"RIchard","2017 BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","Bigger than it looks Driving Dynamics Control with","I recently purchased a 2017 BMW X1 Xdrive.  I have previously owned (2) 3 series and (1) 5 series.  IMO, the 2017 X1 is the best value for the money of all the other BMW's I have owned.  It is not the best handling or planted to the road BMW I've owned, actually it is the least.  But, for its class, its absolutely the best handling and value for money.  For this class(small CUV), I actually prefer the front drive platform to give it the best overall use of space.  This little CUV(I consider it a cuv instead of SUV), because its actually more like a slightly raised hatchback or wagon but looks like a SUV.  The 2017 is slightly revised from the complete remodel in 2016.  The 2016 has a standard sport suspension but for 2017 they changed suspensions and made the sport or M suspension available as an option with the M sport package only.  I assumed I would like the 2016 better but after test driving the 2016 and 2017 models, I actually preferred the 2017 suspension better.  IMO, the 2016 is a little harsh and hard. I think the 2016 having a sport suspension and awd the handling is amazing but a little hard for many people interested in a suv. The 2017 has a more comfortable feeling but still offers terrific handling, especially for its class.  I really enjoy the std ""Driving Dynamics control"" with Eco, comfort and sport settings.  In sport it changes the heft and feel of the steering and even though it probably doesn't effect the suspension, some how it does effect the over all feeling of the handling and seems to improve it.  I drive all the time in sport setting.  I have not driven the FWD only model but I am pretty sure the AWD model provides better handling and a more planted feeling.  For those of you that don't want to purchase the M sports package that includes sport suspension, the standard suspension with sport setting and awd still offers great handling in the 2017.  This car zips around and goes into tight spots pretty easy.  Its actually a small car but feels very big inside and that's because of the front wheel drive platform it offers a much better use of space.  The back seats offer plenty room.  The cargo space in back is plenty big and also there is space underneath the floor on the back that provides even more storage. There is also plenty of head room in the X1.  The quality of the plastics are good, typical Teutonic German simple look but a luxury look and feel to dash.  The std front seat probably needs a little more cushion but the standard vinyl seats look good.  If you are looking for a small suv(cuv) I think the BMW x1 is clearly the best in its class.",5,2017," BMW X1 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

It looks pretty much the same, although I think it is a little larger. The turbo-four still has the nice kick to it. But the ride was hard -- bumpy and uncomfortable compared to my 2013 and especially compared to the X3 we drove.

I live in the North East where snow, ice, rain and cold weather rule here. I feel incredibly comfortable ( I am 6,2"" and it took some time, but now I am used it b) driving this X1 around New England. Mine is the Valencia Orange that is pictured, I like it because the color is very rare around where I live. I have only seen 3/4 including my own. Mine is decked out with everything, the Ultimate Package. The seats heat up fast the steering wheel warmer is an awesome feature that every car in New England should have. I love the look of the car because it is super sporty and turns heads. Just a great looking BMW. Currently wife and I are thinking whether to keep it or not, because we really enjoy the car a lot, but just bought a new truck and we really don't need three vehicles, but it's super hard to sell it because how we feel owning the car - and I think we might regret it if we did. We use this care to go to the beach, driving to work and basically just for traveling and goofing off. Now to the car itself :  The idea of run-flat tires was a good one, but not practical. The car handles like a BMW sports sedan and accelerates in all modes, I love the sport and manual mode. My wife drive it in the automatic regular driving mode. This car is very, very reliable mechanically. The New 8-speed transmission is mated fantastically well with the 2.8 turbo. Our driveway has a slight grade to it that requires our trucks sometimes to be in 4WD mode when we go up it in snow and ice. But the X1 shoots right up it very well all the time. The AWD for this vehicle is amazing, I feel super safe driving the car because the weight of the car and the handling and traction control especially when driving in the snow. The oil changes are every 14/15K miles but we usually do ours around 10K. All and all BMW made a great car here that we totally admire and love to drive.  Really the only maintenance for us has been the oil changes. I honestly feel that the quality of the engine and transmission we should be able to get 225-250K all day long. Take care of it and it will take care of you. I mentioned the car is heavy feeling and it is - if you were to get into an accident all the air bags and shear weight of the vehicle will protect you. As far as mileage goes that kinda subjective - I get between 30-34 on the hwy and 25 in the city, so Audi's cannot even come close to this.

Strong acceleration with minimal turgo lag, especially at highway speeds.  When you need to get power for passing or highway merging the throttle obliges.   The 8 speed transmission operates in background without feeling shifts, really nice.  I acquired the X1 wanting a vehicle for commuting to work with the versatility to handle a run to Loews or a weekend trip for two without having a big SUV since I am mostly driving by myself the majority of the time.  Looked at X3 but the trade off of the extra space versus fuel economy pushed me to the X1.  At this point, I am happy with the decision to get the 2013 CPO X1.  The lone exception to my positive experience is that the sound deadening for the 2013-2015 X1 is less than adequate.  On highways that have grooves or are choppy, the mobile microphone via bluetooth picks up enough road noise to be a nuisance for the person you call.  It's especially challenging if you are on a conference call with others (this happens for me quite a bit).  That said, I look forward to driving the X1 every time I step out the front door.  It has plenty of power, the drive is nearly car-like, and the mineral gray with coral red leather interior and Sport line looks sweet and garners compliments Some items to consider:The Sport seats are WAY more comfortable than the stock seats.  After driving X1's with Sport seats, I only looked at the Sport line.  Drove the price up $1500 or so but I reasoned the seats are part of every drive so I would make up the difference over time of ownership.The genius app very helpful in learning iDrive functions.  My experience thus far is that the voice command functions don't work as well as I would prefer.

Storage with seats down in back is quite plentiful.  Nav works well with the exception of voice commands as already mentioned.After a few months, still feel the same about the X1.

Daily commute is 142 miles. My last 3 series had reached 150K miles, the time I start looking for a replacement.

I have owned the GT for one month. Very comfortable, it's based on the 3 series BMW makes for the China Market - I was told, wealthy individuals in China prefer to have a driver, so BMW needed to make the 3 series longer and wider to provide a larger back seat. This setup works perfectly in the GT. I am 6'1"", perfectly comfortable in the driver seat. The longer wheelbase lends itself to a smoother ride. I really enjoy driving this car, I have the SPORT edition: Blacked out trim, black leather interior, red stitching, brushed aluminum replaces wood on the interior, gray-smoke 18"" wheels, sport wheel with paddle shifters.

Less than two weeks into ownership and there are LOUD rattles emanating from the plastic entertainment console. Simply pressing on the frame halts the annoyance for a brief time or until the next bump.  Other rattles are starting and can't determine their source.  My 10 year old Infinitis have zero rattles.  This car is difficult to get in and out from and the command center is not very intuitive. I'm 6'2"" and sports seats have good support but the seat section could be wider. More than enough leg room, which is great. The car has terrific storage capacity, comparable or better than many SUV's. Never have to worry about the car bottoming out on rough road or a steep driveway, as it rides fairly high. AWD gives immediate handling confidence. Update 03/18/17: Still enjoying the car, less the ""premium"" rattles. Dealer did not resolve the problem...they applied a smelly oily substance between the plastic parts and no improvement. Interior rattles when temps are between 60-80 degrees. I recently noticed, in very bright light, that the #5 radio button has a horizontal hairline crack. I suspect that my radio was roughly handled before it was installed.Update 10/17/17: Had car serviced and they replaced cracked radio buttons and reinstalled radio.

In order to turn off the electronics (they DO NOT turn off automatically after a period of time), you must press the on/off button AGAIN with your foot off the pedal.  Don't forget that, or else you will turn the car BACK ON.  This same logic applies to almost every aspect of the car....from unlocking the doors while inside (no way to program an ""all unlock"") to navigation to Bluetooth.  Yikes.  I realized that I would be working with a learning curve when moving from a Lexus to BMW, but really?  No front camera to help with parking?

We have four kids with only one left in a forward facing seat. I coach lacrosse and need trunk space, LOTS of it. But, I was so tired of the MOM car. Tired of feeling like I have to drive around such a huge vehicle all the time. I have had my Armada for 10 years and love it. We will keep it, but my first car ever was a BMW and I love the sporty drive of them. I missed that. However, I wanted space and safety going from a big SUV. People miss that BMWs are the ONLY cars that offer front and rear roll over bars and all the air bags they have! For my family that is huge! The complaints of spending $58k on this we don’t have. We made the new buy mistake on the Armada and that initial depreciation is HUGE! So we bought certified used and ours is loaded/luxury with almost every option out the door with GREAT miles for $28500. Still have two years unlimited miles of the original warranty and because it’s a SULEV we have 15 years 150,000 miles on all emissions related items here in California. My husband is 6’4” and fits fantastic in this car! It is, in fact, the first car he has ever felt comfortable sitting in, and can even sit comfortably in the back WITH the seat at the position he needs it to drive! It offers that much room! We can sit two kids and a booster in back comfortably, and another sits up front. They are 12, 11, 10, and 4 and fit fine. My husband has comfortably had four grown Marines in this many days out to lunch! It’s a phenomenal car with lots of spunk. Easy to drive. Corners are best to accelerate through like all bimmers! Some may take them too slow and miss the agility. It hugs the ground fine for me coming from an Armada. We also bought an X1 silver with a blacked out Sport package and red interior. It looks amazing and love it! They ride completely different, offer is the same abilities, same huge sunroofs, lots of cargo, one is a tighter steering and I like that. This car is a bit looser for a BMW drive, but it’s great! We get amazing gas mileage in it. There is some hard plastic down low on the dash. I love our black and dark tan interior and Alpine white exterior! Our car is beautiful and we get asked about it everywhere we go. The cargo is abundant, and we can drive two cars and get better mileage than my armada when parking is plenty, or we can all load up in the Armada! Buy used, or lease, I can’t understand the complaints on this car. Buy a BMW for the sportier drive. It is a drivers car! If you want lush and plush and super luxurious vehicles go somewhere else.

When I saw this car at the dealer, I was very interested. It has plenty of rear seat legroom, which isn't something I could say about my 328. The model I leased is a 2014 with the M Sport, Premium, Lighting, Technology, Both driver's assistance, Cold weather, and Harmon Kardon sound packages. It is in Mineral Grey, which I am having second thoughts on. I wish I had the Black Sapphire like my old car. After living with it for about a year, the GT's numerous flaws revealed themselves. I do a lot of city driving, but even with my light foot and tendency to use Eco Pro, I am averaging 17.2 MPG. I have had SUVs that did better than that with bigger engines. The engine is very gruff at higher revs, and sounds like a diesel with all of that clatter. I do like the large moonroof and Harmon Kardon sound system. The trunk is nicely finished and very large. When I'm driving, I notice that my knees hit nothing but hard plastic or wood. It is very annoying, and for this price, I would expect a better designed interior. The rear seat has limited head room. I also noticed how loud it is on the freeway or in neighborhoods. At cruising speeds, I can barely hold a conversation with my rear passengers due to the wind and road noise. I regret getting the M Sport because it rides rougher and I am tired of it. I love the latest version of iDrive. The front seats aren't very accommodating.

This is a nice looking car and the performance thus far is good.  I get numerous compliements  about how nice the car looks. My biggest complaint is the ""Wind Noise"" which affects the driving experince is away that is soooooo annoyingto the point of frustration .  I strongly feel BMW of North America  needs to address this flaw.  When the  radio and/ other media isnt turned on, the noise is unbearable so I find myself turning on and up music to in order to not hear the noise. There are so many days I want to drive without music etc yet toomuch winds noise I always have some type of media playing. I place my hand near the roof to get a feel of where the air is coming from.  It's as though it isnt sealed tight to prevent outside niise and wind.  I had a Infinity with a sunroof and the ride-noise free-no wind which leads me to believe this is a Big problem BMW doesn't want to deal with.  The reason for saying this, I verbally brought this to the attnetion of my service advisor, Service Director  numeroustimes to no avail. I was  told by the service Director,  he would test drive a car like mine to see if he experience the same, I havent gotten ffedback,.  Service advisor said bring in back in so a techinician could ride along with me.  Well my car has been in the service dept for regular maintence so why dealership cant follow-up on my concern.  I plan to address this matter in wiritting soon.  For the price, i shouldn't have ride uncomfortable.  Additionally, while traveling on the interstate, local roadway with speed greater than 40, noise is evident. I curious to know if others who own a 328I GT experience this as well.  As months and years past, this good result in water penetrating through the roof and burning gas because heat and or cold air can be felt when you put your hand where the wind noise is.

For me, it is the kind of car that will make me glad I have to drive somewhere. The Sports seat comfort with thigh-support pull-out is excellent, as are the adjustable bolsters. I have a bad back with L5-S1 herniation history, yet don't have the leather, or lumbar supports, but don't need  or want them! I switched over from Buick, primarily because of seat support and comfort. The firm ride handles everything quite nimbly, for such a heavy absorbent BMW feel. I got the Sport Line trim package, with the optional M-Sport steering wheel, overall a very nice appearance. I get a lot of stares and questions on it; the Silver metallic with Sports Line trim (+ tinted windows and an added rear hatch window spoiler). There is a bit of delay in acceleration on occasion, its almost like you have to time it to get it right; despite the twin-scroll turbo which improves things, but once it goes (you MUST use Sports+ Mode to actually feel it), it rocks! The grandkids always beg me ""Opa, put it in Sport Mode!"". Braking is solid. There is a tad bit of sway for significant cornering, expected but not bad for a heavier car (I was told that this is actually a 5-series platform/chassis, but I haven't been able to confirm that; if you are cross-shopping w/the 4 series Gran Coupe/GC, one dealer actually said the 3GT is actually a 5-series, and the 4GC is actually a 3-series!).  There is a bit of engine noise during hard acceleration, but it is not bad. There is a bit of sunroof wind noise, probably my primary complaint overall as the ride experience goes (made much worse by the base rack which I now only use when transporting bikes/kayaks), but yet I am still able to chair tele-conferences with no problems while speaking or hearing on other end via Bluetooth, which is consistent and without problems despite previous reviewers comments. Road noise is minimal, enough to know your in a motor vehicle, but kept to a minimum. I love the back liftgate, as it is easier to load and unload than a typical trunk. It is by intent a coupe design, meaning a lowered-in cockpit feel, so getting in and out is not as easier as you might think for a car that sits higher than a traditional 3-series sedan. The infotainment system works great; you can look at the large monitor screen while scrolling and tapping, without even looking at the iDrive you are manipulating with your right hand...and the base stereo which is Harmon-Kardon is actually pretty good, but I am going to upgrade the front dash & door speakers because I am an audiophile. I agree with a friend who used to work in an upscale audio center that the low end preforms very well (as there are 2 subwoofers, located underneath the front seats), the midrange and high end/tweeter are fine/good but not great. The Nav works very well and is worth it. The internal HD for music storage is a great feature, but I HATE how it only plays back the songs on a CD that you recorded in alphabetical order --- word to BMW: album rock and live music CDs are meant to be played in the track order recorded, stop being so organized you Germans!:). Playing off a thumbdrive is also very easy, and the steering wheel mounted controls help, although I believe in terms of human ergonomics, that the volume and media controls should be on the Left side of the steering wheel, NOT the Right [if you look at the actual dash stereo controls and the steering wheel stereo controls, they are literally only about 6 inches apart from each other, so the point of saving a reach or having multiple ways to do the same thing is minimized; why not place those stereo controls on the Left, now you can control the stereo functions with either your Left or your Right hand?]!I have averaged in the high 20s for MPG in mixed driving; I do not gun it a lot, but I certainly drive it in a more spirited manner a couple times a week! I have averaged 36-38 MPG on long trips in ECO mode, one trick to doing this well (I once got 39 MPG on a long trip!) is increasing the tire pressures to 33 PSI-front & 36 PSI-back (32 & 35 recommended, but there is always an acceptable range).  Check & adjust your PSI twice a month, so many people don't do this and it is extremely important, especially the way the vehicle dynamics in this vehicle work, and the fact that front & rear are 3 PSI difference! The handling, agility, and MPG are significantly affected by PSI.",4,2015," BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo Hatchback 328i xDrive SULEV 4dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

The newest iDrive system has some neat features, but lacks the simplicity of the previous version. The base sound system is actually pretty good. The front seats are okay, but the headrests are uncomfortable at any position. The adjustable bolsters are not overly confining. The way the center console and doors are designed make for some very hard places for resting your knees. There is lots of hard plastics around the center console. The rear seat has much better legroom than my 5, but the sloping roof and small windows take away headroom. The seats are not very soft and fitting 3 in the back is a punishment. Visibility is awful in the back. It has large 19 inch wheels, but it rides adequately. The car is very noisy inside. Lots of road and engine noise come in. The noise makes it difficult to make phone calls, and the Bluetooth is temperamental. The engine is smooth, although at times it will pause, and suddenly lurch forward. It becomes quite nauseating. The engine is extremely unrefined at cold startup. I had the same issue with the 5. For 54K, this is unacceptable. The frameless doors sure look great, and make a solid thud when closed. But be careful, because there are sharp edges, and my mother cut her arm walking by an open front door. The standard panoramic moonroof is massive. It's probably my favorite thing about this car. The xenon headlights are worth the extra cost. My 528i was okay on gas, but this car is not as efficient. I think it's because the car is heavier. It is noticeably less fun than the regular 3.

I'm so sick of these so called experts not giving this beast of a car the respect it deserves! Ok, I admit I didn't care for the body style at first, but the uniqueness of it's style distinguishes it from it's competitors, and it didn't take any time for that body style to grow on me. As far as the cargo space, it's a little smaller than the X5, but so what! The car has a unique sleek design so I would expect for a little of the cargo space to be compromised. This is NOT a typical size/style SUV. It's a crossover/hybrid/sports suv with a luxurious twist. I will also admit that there is limited visibility when you look to your right in the back, but the large side mirrors, and with me always being mindful of quickly looking over my right shoulder before I change lanes is enough to compensate for that, and quite frankly is something people should do anyway with or without having this SUV. The sound system is fantastic, and the IDrive utilization has come a long way, and is very functional.

Currently own a 911 Porsche and Panamera along with a 650 Dodge Ram and Toyota Four Runner.  I've owned BMW 550 and 740 as well.  This is the best driving vehicle of the lot.  It's still a big vehicle but doesn't handle like one.  My 911 is a 1999 and rides like a Go-Cart.  The Panamera feels like a big car.   Now that I'm in my 50's I much prefer sitting a bit higher and knowing I have the acceleration and stopping ability of a much smaller vehicle.   It is the most fun I have had driving any vehicle.  I'm not fascinated by the look of the vehicle, but then that's what lured me in.  I like to drive fast and don't want to be conspicuous.  Most folks simply don't know how much power this SUV really has.  It will blow both of my Porshe cars off the line.  Excellent braking has saved me from a couple of certain accidents over the past 5 years.   The downside is kids have a difficult time seeing out of the back seats.  And there are only 2 back seats.  I wish there was a bench seat option so we could carry 5 passengers.   My daughter is now practicing for her driving test and I let her drive my X6M.  She didn't like the vehicle having spent her life in the back seat.  The fully adjustable seat allowed her 4'10'' frame to adjust to a position where she could see well and feel very comfortable.   After her first drive she expressed that ""your car is way nicer than the Toyota!""  She needed to adjust her foot pressure on both the accelerator and the brake.  Both are far more responsive than the other vehicles we have.   My X6M is the best car I have ever owned.  My wife expected me to be looking for a new car and asked me about it.  I told her I'm happy with the X6M.  As long as I can get it detailed I'm good for a couple more years at least. Oh, the gas mileage is poor at about 15 mpg and the gas tank is small ~20 gal.  So I have to hit the gas station at least weekly and sometimes more.  My Wife names all of our vehicles.  The X6M is named ""Thirsty"".",5,2010," BMW X6 M SUV 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 6A)"

Never was really considering this model until I drove it at the dealership....it was fun. I am 72 years old and 6'2"" and yes, I go through a circus act to get in the back seat area. But in reality, at home there is only the wife and myself. If we have to share the car with adult passengers, you can make it work. Frankly, I enjoy just getting out and driving this little coupe. I have taken it out on a road trip, and it is a comfortable ride. It is not made to be a luxuary riding vehicle, so yes, you will feel bumps..so what? My only complaint is that the seat belt is a far reach behind me, and I do not have satellite radio, or a navagation system but like I say...I bought the 'plain jane' and I can live without the extras......after all, I grew up in those years where you paid extra for an AC radio, and later,  air conditioning was extra when it came on autos. The insturment panel reminds me of the old racing cars. This 4 cylinder turbo gas car has neck popping pick up, tracks true and will hug the curves. It is comfortable, and BMW put some style and nice lines on this car. Take a test drive and see if you remember when you once had a car that put a smile on your face, just driving no where in particular.December 29, 2016: My review of this car remains unchanged. Believe it or not, I wrote BMW about the navagation system on my 5 series asking why, with all their technical knowledge, they did not have a simple way to update navagation. My 2 series does not have navigation, but I solved it with a 10 year old Nuvi I put on the console held with a rubber band when I took a long trip. I get free life time updates on a hand held Nuvi that I paid around $200 for, and it has voice directions and shows filling stations hospitals etc...everything the high priced autos have, only the new car systems of major brands, are already 2 to 3 years old when they hit the show room floor.  I can update my Nuvi by plugging it into my computer. I get ALL of North America on it. Right down to the new bypass installed around a park near my home.Again. I love driving the 228i. Have had absolutly no problems with it, hugs the road and curves. Great pickup and will get you around slow moving traffic in a flash on the expressway. You can also pack more into the trunk then you think. I do carry an air pump and a can of sealant because I have run flat tires, and while they have been no problem, I am just old school and needed peace of mind.UPDATE Jan 2018. I traded in the 228i for a 2017 M240 series. It was like saying goodbye to a family member, but I wanted to move up to a six cylinder with more options. The 228i did not remain on the lot of the dealers very long, and hopefully the new owners realize it was well cared for.

Also, took delivery of a new Colorado last year (worst purchase ever), just replaced it with a new Tacoma (a great truck).For me, the comparison between the Japanese products with which I am familiar and the German offering is quite interesting. While I would not trade my BMW coupe for anything, I think the Japanese are a bit ahead in a couple of areas. The 2 Series coupe auto shift is not nearly as smooth as what I am used to in the Tacoma or Honda. In fact, I sometimes think I could manual shift smoother. It was not a deal breaker but my 2014 Honda had perforated leather seat inserts, just like i used to spec out when I sold new business jets. It makes the leather softer to sit on and cooler in the summer. The leather on my new 2 Series did not come perforated which I would have preferred.In spite of BMW's very clever use of computer technology, the main gages are what we in the aircraft industry call steam gages.

It's certainly no bargain and we spent another $2,000 for a different wheel and tire package because we didn't like the M's all-grey rims.We have now owned the car for over a year and we absolutely love it.  My wife uses it as an everyday car and I for the convertible and fun to drive.  Would absolutely buy the car again if making the choice.

Great for getting that sporty-car feeling. Plus, the shifting is easy and the gas mileage is great (26 city; 35 highway). The ride, on COMFORT is very smooth. Select SPORT and it firms-up a little. The seats are VERY comfortable. It is a little clumsy to get out of the car. You sort of have to climb up and out. Definitely a younger persons car ( I was 73 when I bought the car). BMW service has been good. I have had ZERO problems in the 1 1/2 years I have owned the car. Mine is an M-Sport model. A little sportier than the standard 228i. It has the Track Handling Package.

The point is the car is small, which results in better overall handling. You can throw it into sport mode, toss this car around and it will hold. With the M sport package you get a tightened up suspension which makes it that much more fun. In terms of technology, the infotainment system / navigation is on point. Quite possibly the best navigation system out of all the german brands, which speaks to BMW's design model. The one con is the tires. I don't know who approved run flats as standard on the East Coast, but it was a poor decision, as I've gone through countless tires because of rough roads and potholes. Not sure what tires are standard for the MY17 cars.  Otherwise one of the most fun rides I will ever own.",5,2015," BMW 2 Series Coupe 228i xDrive 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

I will still say if I could change one thing about this car it would be the steering feel...I hope someday there will be a tune option for that.  6/19/16 Update:I just brought the vehicle in for its first oil change and had no issues in the first 6 months.  My lifetime fuel economy has improved to over 32 mpg.  The car does very well on the highway, but I've noticed in the little city driving I do, it will be down in the 20s due to idling.  When I dropped my car off for an oil change I got a 2016 M235i convertible as a loaner and really enjoyed it.  While the 6-cylinder engine is certainly fun and impressive, I am still happy with the torque and performance of the 228i's 2.0L.  If I were to take one thing from the M235i to my car though, it would be the sport steering.  There is more resistance and I liked the steering feel much better. If you are looking into this car to enjoy the driving experience, I highly recommend you go for the variable sport steering (not just the M-sport steering wheel).  I believe this comes with the track handling package, which also means you'll get upgraded brakes.  So far, this is the only thing I wish I did differently when choosing options, but am still very happy with the car.Original Review:I bought this car after seriously considering a VW GTI, which you can buy at a lower price point. (Note I would have also considered the Audi A3, but no manual transmission was a deal breaker, and the GTI really is the same car with a different appearance.) However this was a 2015 and I was able to get a strong deal (about $6000 below MSRP, otherwise I probably wouldn't have been willing to go for it).  After considering the performance benefits, maintenance included, nicer styling, and learning that I would actually pay more for insurance on the VW, I chose the 228i.Compared to the VW, you get a nicer engine with much less/no turbo lag and better handling from 50/50 weight distribution and RWD.  Also, in my opinion, this car looks much better than the VW.  This is actually my first RWD car, having previously owned a Mazda.  In comparison, I enjoy the more upscale interior and quieter cabin.  I have the Harmon Kardon audio system and enjoy it very much.  I've even had two adults in the back seat and consider the space reasonable for this size coupe, but it is certainly easier to get in and out of the back seat of a sedan.  The front seats are sufficiently roomy and comfortable, and I have been impressed by the visibility as I have less of a blind spot than I did in my Mazda.Regarding driving feel, I will say in my first few weeks, I missed my Mazda's tight steering feedback and the BMW gearbox took a little adjusting for me.  In contrast, in a test drive, I felt the VW gearbox was quite smooth and easy to get used to.  Now that I have had some time in the car, I feel accustomed to the gearbox.  The BMW ride is quieter and comfortable, but with 18"" wheels, some of the larger expansion joints can become more noticeable.  I've been impressed by the mileage that I've been getting so far. I have been averaging 31 mpg driving gently and using the ECO PRO mode often.  Acceleration is sluggish in ECO PRO, but there is certainly no reason not to use it when cruising on the highway.  Switching between the modes is very easy beside the shifter.  Sport mode makes awakens a totally different personality of more torque and faster throttle response.  I opted for the M-Sport suspension, so that gets activated in sport mode as well - truly fun to drive.  My driving is mostly highway with about 20% side roads/city.  The auto shut-off feature, which is an annoyance to some, is something I appreciate when stopped for a while.  The engine starts right up as soon as I depress the clutch and if I don't want the engine to shut off, it is easy to disable or hold off for a moment by keeping the clutch depressed.  Last, BMW comes with regenerative breaking, which also contributes to fuel savings.  These features and some other subtleties in the BMW come standard, but are not available in many other cars.  In the end, I have a feeling I am getting better fuel economy than I would be able to in the VW.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase (despite some hiccups with the dealer experience, but that has never been smooth for me).  I'll note that BMW's options and packages can make things confusing for the buyer as there are so many configurations, and some things that should come standard on an upscale vehicle don't.  For me, the overall rating is between 4 and 5 stars due to the things that BMW nickel and dimes you for (such as key-less entry and Bluetooth on the 2015) and an infotainment system that could be a little more streamlined, although I have gotten used to it and do like it.  If you do your research, you can spec out a great car.

I live in the midwest so decided to get xDrive, which is only available with the 8 speed ZF automatic. My last 4 BMW's had manual transmissions and rear wheel drive but I wanted a car that handled well in both good and bad weather and one my wife wouldn't complain too loudly about driving occasionally. I can't afford to buy both a weekend fair weather car and a commuter car for year round driving so I bought a car that does both well. The car is a rocket-the xDrive is faster than its' manual or automatic rear drive counterparts and only about .1 second slower to 60 than the M2. I do miss the manual trans. but this ZF is unreal, upshifting and downshifting when it should. I wish BMW would go to a touch screen interface for radio, nav., etc. because the iDrive can be tedious. The car could use a couple more USB ports-there's ONE in the console, that's it. Voice recognition works great for both on board and Siri use with Apple Car Play. The 360 degree distance sensors are excellent and will even warn you of a curb your front or rear end is about to scrape. Haven't tried auto-park yet. The suspension adjusts from firm to firmer, but hey, I didn't buy the car to drive grandma to church. Trunk room is more than adequate and the rear seats fold if more room is needed. Before I bought the BMW I looked at the Camaro SS-like sitting in a tank, no visibility (but that LT1 sounds fantastic!) and the Ford Mustang GT-nice but bland. Both Camaro and Mustang have less rear seat room than the BMW, which has adequate leg room but limited head room (those over 5'5 will be uncomfortable). They also had belt lines so high you couldn't rest your arm on the door. I find myself looking for excuses to drive this car-it reminds me of my first BMW, a '69 2002, but on steroids. In an age when cars are constantly getting bigger and heavier BMW has gone the other direction and created a modern day throwback-thanks, BMW!Update-I now have 12700 miles on the car and love it more than ever. I had a Dinan Elite piggyback ecu mod. installed which raised hp to 414 and torque to 479lb ft and has a warranty that is the same as factory, 4 years/50,000 miles. Wow, talk about making something  great into something special-blindingly fast but still quiet-no drama just seamless speed. The car and I are one, she is an extension of me. I dream, like all car nuts do, of having other cars but the bottom line is that for the money I can't think of a car I'd rather have as a daily driver; it's near perfection.",5,2017," BMW 2 Series M240i xDrive M240i xDrive 2dr Coupe AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

But either because of it's enormous weight (over 4,200 pounds) or the fact that it is a convertible and thus not as stiff, no matter what mode the car is in the car is really too wobbly and you feel this from lane changes, slightly twisty roads, and definitely on mountain roads.  Because of this, I feel this is more of a highway cruiser than a sports car, I wouldn't even call it sporty.  It rolls around like a boat and I hated the way the car felt when the road even got remotely twisty.  Another thing that takes away from the sporty DNA I typically associate with BMW is the fact that the it has BMW's fantastic new 8-Speed transmission, but you really have no idea what the engine is doing because you could barely feel or hear the engine.  I also had major gripes with the value because besides the LCD dashboard screen, the interior didn't feel any bit as different as the interior of my X5 from the same year, which was much cheaper and has the same engine.  The X5 even had a plus on this thing because it had these interior mood lights which made you feel like you were in a nightclub or something.  The entertainment was also the same in that the stereo wasn't any better, and there weren't any more features as what I could work out.  Overall I thought this car was fast and comfortable on a highway, dependable and efficient, but also too expensive, boring, and the handling is terrible.",4,2016," BMW 6 Series Convertible 640i 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

(which, unfortunately, ended Feb of this year).  For a convertible, there's less road noise then a hard top, sound in speakers is great, going 80 feels like you're driving 40, no squeaks or leaks in the roof.  This car is a 2012 with zero issues.   As any luxury car, you can expect a high maintenance bill, but don't get one if you can't afford it.  Just make sure you take it to a BMW dealership and you're covered.  Warranty does cover any electrical and mechanical issues - anything outside of wear and tear.  The only thing to watch for is the convertible.  My last one (I was 3rd owner) had a big top stopping mid-way issue which, although covered by warranty, they wouldn't cover until it was ""adjusted"", which came out of my pocket.  When I asked ""what the *** is an ""adjustment""?  they told me it was the responsibility of the owner to ""adjust"" the sensors before they will repair anything.  I told them being the 3rd owner, how was I supposed to know this?  Where in the BMW manual does it say this?  Arguing with a warranty company is comparable to banging your head against a brick wall, so I ended up having to pay $900 out of pocket for something that failed, AGAIN, a few weeks later, that, yes, had to be fixed, which I had to pay another $300 for the warranty deductible, but they did fix.  I still don't understand what happened, but be weary of that.  (side story: I'm also a lifetime Miata owner/fan with 3 under my belt.  I'm an original 2004 mazdaspeed owner and not once has that car been in the shop - lesson?  The more electronics you have in a car, the more problems you'll have)  Anyway, back to this car, since the 2007, the 2012, has definitely fixed a lot of its electronic glitches and what appeared to be transmission ""jumping"" in my 07, is now gone in my 12.

This is my 5th BMW and sadly my first review, were I feel compelled to put out there, what my disappointments have been. I understand that one can be the unlucky bearer of a rare lemon. However the abysmal difference of expiereiences with this, my first US made BMW makes me believe that there could be fundamental quality control differences between plants. Here is what went wrong: loud ringing on the right-rear column (4 visits to repair), transmission box failure (1 visit, but the engine sounds funny, when going up a hill, ever since), cargo door would open on its own (3 visits where I was mostly blamed for ""inadvertently hitting the open button"", until on the 4th visit, they found that there was in deed an issue), failure of the soft-locking mechanism (this being the worst of all issues, as the doors would open by themselves while the vehicle was being operated!!). I swear this to be true. It took 4 visits as well, where BMW service centers would refuse to fix the problem since they had to ""witness"" the issue happening. The challenge being that if the episodes would happen at random, the service tecnitians could not drive around the car for days until they actually saw the phenomenon happen. So of course, as a customer, to have to deal with the disbelief of the dealerships, while being forced to drive around when doors can open at any time, is beyond frustrating. I believe that BMW still makes very good product, but I have moved my vote of no confidence in the North Carolina quality control and for the first time in 15 years, I steered off from BMW SUV's.",3,2014," BMW X5 SUV sDrive35i 4dr SUV (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

It rides comfortably.  The voice commands are still iffy and make mistakes.  I speak clearly with no accent and it still makes mistakes, especially on navigating and pulling up your phone contact list.  I drive 50% in traffic in Atlanta and 50% highway driving on GA 400.  The gas mileage on highway never gets above 18 to 19mpg.  The gas mileage in traffic gets 15 to 17mpg.  The average per the computer is 17.3 after 6 months.  I took the car in and the technicians said this is normal and there are no settings to improve the gas mileage other than using eco-boost.  I frequently use the eco-boost mode and it makes about .2mpg difference.  Very little. I am light on the throttle and brakes about 80% of the time, so I don't think that's a big factor. The technician said the advertised mpg from BMW is shown under ideal conditions on a track and going 55 miles per hour.  I wish BMW disclosed this when I first purchased the car. I end up filling my car twice a week now.  My wife's Lexus RX 350 is a comparable SUV and gets about 24 miles per gallon, with similar driving habits and good acceleration.  Its a much better deal.  Corvette gets better gas mileage which is pretty sad.  The only thing I like better about the BMW X5 over the Lexus RX350 is the entertainment system.  Much more intuitive and easier to use in BMW.

This feature has been standard on all 5 series since 2012 and is especially useful for an SUV.

The 2012 X5 has 28K miles on it and warranty expired in October '15. In early October, the car called BMW and said service was required. We took it and they could not say what service was needed. We told them to replace the wipers since we were there on our $1,000+ extended service plan. So far we have gotten two sets of wipers and two oil changes for our $1000. Don't buy that plan from them. It covers little. In December '15 the vehicle was leaking oil in the garage. They determined it was leaking from a hose going to the turbocharger and fixed it as a courtesy beyond the warranty period at no charge. 45 days later it was leaking again in the same spot in the garage. This time it was determined that the turbocharger needed replaced. They agreed to replace it with a 5% deductible of $263. Each trip there is painful. The service department is grossly understaffed. Today there was one adviser there, with a line waiting to see her. She was literally running, doing her best. After a 10 minute wait to pay and a 10 minute wait to get the vehicle, I was out. The car smells like glue really strong. I got an appraisal too, no longer having peace of mind. Our $60K car is now worth $18K private party/$12K trade in after 6 years, 4 months and 36,000 miles. BMW no longer holds it's value. Our 15 years of BMW loyalty are at an end. The quality of product has declined, and the dealer experiences are time consuming and frustrating. BMW is supposed to give you peace of mind and the ultimate driving experience. For us, they have failed. We went back to the dealer for a seat calibration warning in April 2017. Service department did good work. We waited while work was done and browsed the showroom. Salesman all around their central kiosk. After looking at new X5s I asked a salesperson a question about the new technology package. He told me to look on line for details. No interest in selling a new car (which would be a hard sell based on our X5 quality issues.

The thoughtfulness of the designers is amazing, and the execution is making a nearly 5000lb car feel like it weighs 2000lbs less is something to behold.  Compared to the old E53 body style, the E70 feels like it's carved out of one piece of metal and has attained an overall higher level of refinement.  The main drawback of these is that the complexity of the car adds to the maintenance costs, and that's reflected in the relatively low resale value once the warranty expires.  Overall, the car is solid and built well, but there are a ton of gadgets (e.g. every door is soft-close).  The drivetrain is robust, but expect problems with the CDI fuel injectors (the cowl area at the base of the hood is not sealed correctly and drips water onto #5 & 6), which cost ~$700 each and there are six of them.  The ""clean"" part of ""clean diesel"" also is troublesome with expensive repairs to the DPF, SCR active tank, NOx sensors, etc., often required.

No problems to speak of, drove a lot (15,000 miles so far), had one service, and still going strong.THE GOOD STUFF:As far as a driving machine goes this car is very hard to fault.  Coming from a manual transmission car I was afraid I was going to lose some of that sporty fun of shifting gears, but this has a very good select-shift automatic that is fast and doesn't nanny you too bad.  The push forward for downshifts and push back for upshifts is also more akin to racing cars, which is great.  The MOST amazing thing about this car is definitely the fuel efficiency.  For my mix of commuting of road trips, I'm averaging about 26 mpg, which is about the same I got with my old Mark V GTI, which is a 4-cylinder compact car.  The fact that I can get that kind of mpg of a car so heavy and powerful is nothing short of amazing.  A large thanks to this is the 8 speed transmission, which barely spins the engine when you are in top gear on the highway and still lets you have some low-end power for gentle passing.  Besides that it holds corners very well, brakes well, and acceleration is very strong when you need it.  It'll happily cruise at around 80-90 mph and when passing it'll reach up to 115 or so without much trouble.  One of my favorite things is that when you are in drive and push shifter to the manual mode, it'll automatically shift down two gears as though it knows you are trying to pass on a narrow road.  Even in Comfort mode the ride is quite firm.  A lot of people associate ""luxury"" cars with plush rides and supreme quiet.  This is not that car, this is for someone who enjoys driving and feeling the road for sure.  It's a refined ride for sure, so you don't feel fatigued even after many hours of driving.  It's also got a huge gas tank so you don't have to stop and fill up too often (~5oo miles per fillup) The steering is electric and takes some getting used to I thing, but once you do, you don't really think about it's little weirdnesses too much.  The space is immense and it has a lot of storage for items and various small knickknacks.Besides that It's got all the standard luxury car fare like rain sensing wipers, bright headlights, seat memory, electronic trunk close, backup camera and all that.  They all work as they should, but the seat memory is particularly notable in that it memorizes the position of the side mirrors as well, which I feel is the most difficult thing to get right.THE BAD:For as much as I like the car, there are a few things that are annoying.  The first is the looks, while I like it, I liked the previous generation better, it was more aggressive and masculine.  The 2015 one looks a little more subdued and feminine.  The driving is great, but it's so heavy and has so many gears that the engine braking is not great on moderate downhills.  The only other thing I wish could be improved with the driving experience are the automatic headlights.  It seems to come on when it is almost totally dark, I wish it would come on sooner.  I've also yet to find a why to prevent the air conditioning to stop turning itself on when you start the car on a hot day.  This means I'm constantly turning it off.  Like many German cars, it's also a huge hypochondriac in that it tells you to pull over and go to a dealership even when a tire has slightly low pressure due to cold weather.  That is very annoying and alarming when you are trying to just drive casually somewhere.      When it comes to the iDrive.  The only good thing about the map is how you can instantly zoom in and out with the use of the track wheel thingy, but the routes are really dimwitted.  The new letter tracking input is just not easier than the normal track wheel letter selection.  It's just too hard to get right at 70 mph.  The iPhone/iPod integration is also bad because it is meant to be universal so it works like a really dimwitted file directory sort of system so you can't do advanced features specific to your device.  I'm also really disappointed the stereo has no midrange control, it has a great set of speakers, but it's hard to get the midrange out for sure.The primary reason I chose the X5 over its direct competitors, the Lexus RX, Acura MDX, Audi Q5/Q7, Mercedes M Class, Porsche Cayenne, etc. is that l preferred the look of the exterior and interior over all the others.  Having had a BMW in Europe I knew what to expect with the driving experience.  What I wasn't prepared for coming from a VW to a this car, in America at least, is just how hated you can be in the real world.

Not as plush a ride as Lexus or Lincoln.  Car not made for short people who are 5'1"", but I can work around it.  Car is my husband's car, and fits him well. Hard for me to see over high dash on driver's side, hard to get out of car without bruising back of calves (but salesman showed me the trick on how short people can get out more easily), back of front seat cushion makes seat uncomfortable for short people, as the cushion pushes my back out.  It hits the right place of the back on regular-height and tall people.  If I sit on a pillow, the back of the front-seat cushion fits my back fine, but I shouldn't have to do this in an expensive car like this. Car handles beautifully, quiet inside, high-quality materials.  Hard for me to see blind spot when I turn around due to my height.  Biggest complaint is difficulty of using the features, changing a radio station, finding what you want on the screen.  There are some buttons, but most features accessed by a mouse-type wheel on the console.  Very dangerous to find what you want while you're driving.   Mercedes is much more intuitive and easier to use.  No current weather outside is displayed for the passenger - it only shows for the driver!  This should be standard in all cars.  Also, was told by salesman that the rear-view mirror would display the direction you're headed with an ""N,"" ""NE,"" etc., but it doesn't.  Also, you cannot use Maximum A/C or Heat on the floor only.  Being short, this is important to me, as the middle vents always blow in my face and eyes.  However, happily and  surprisingly, the BMW vents can be directed so it doesn't blow in my face, unlike the Mercedes.  Storage space is adequate; nice, extra storage compartment under floor in very back if you do not use it for a spare tire, which you shouldn't need with the run-flat tires.  Glove compartment is small for size of car - the manual takes up the whole glove compartment.  My husband absolutely loves the car.  It is fun to drive, even for short people!

It exudes quality of build everyplace you look. I'm a diesel fan so I've owned diesel cars and SUV's in the past but I never realized until owning this car that the short coming of those past vehicles was to a large degree the under designed transmissions that they were equipped with.  In this vehicle the diesel engine and 8 speed transmission are impeccably matched. The transmission allows the engine to work at it's most efficient torque level / RPM at all speeds thereby rendering phenomenal fuel economy for a 5,000 + Lb. vehicle. I'm talking 32 to 34 MPG on the highway consistantly at 70 to 75 MPH (around 1700 RPM - Just Incredible...). At the time of this writing I'm in the middle of a cross country road trip (5000 mi. so far) from Florida to Oregon and I can tell you that the comfort and drivability of the X5 35D make long trips something to look forward to. Don't just drive this one back and forth to the grocery store. Take her out and stretch her legs on a long road trip and you'll be glad you did. Oh, I forgot to mention that with it's 22.5 ga. fuel capacity and more than 650 mile highway range you can drive pretty much all day without stopping for fuel. Yes there are a few shortcomings, but they are few. I find that German cars are typically behind the 8 ball when it comes to entertainment system electronics. Bluetooth is a bit quirky. There's no Apple Play in this 2015 model but I believe that's been addressed in later models. The Nav is great but the ""Points of Interest"" database is sorely lacking. Being a Floridian I notice that the A/C could be a little more robust for my tastes but it's not a deal killer. I bought the 100,000 mi.

It quiets down at highway speeds, but the exhaust noise is constant, intrusive, and can be annoying. In the first 5,000 miles, mpg was 24.5 mixed and 29.5 highway.

At about 2-3k miles again, going to Austin for the weekend from Houston, and my low oil light come back on again. Took it back to the dealer and they added over 2 quarts of oil. I asked them why the oil consumption, and their response was it's normal. A month or two, rolls out and the Aux. Pump goes out. No problem since it's still under warranty and your driving on a brand new loner car for 3 weeks, since they were on backorder from Germany. A couple of month go by without any issues and then the high battery consumption light come. They replaced the battery and a couple of module and returned the vehicle back in a couple of day, no problem. A couple of months go by again, and bam, the battery light come back again, took it back to the dealer, they kept the vehicle for over a month this time, saying they couldn't find the issue and when they finally did, it turned out to be a right front door handle, that would not dormant.

Love the diesel and, over the past several years, it's cheaper to operate than the premium gas version - also get better mileage (24.6mpg). Easy to get in/out of, very comfortable, great visibility and performance, reliable for at least the first 6-7 years (up to 70,000 miles). Couple of nuisance items prior to warranty expiration: Leather seat issue, cracked woodgrain trim. After I hit the 70,000 mile mark, The repairs started getting expensive. $2300 for the shocks & struts (not bad but did them before they were shot), $2450 for a catalytic converter, $800 for a thermostat, $1300 for Throttle Actuator and Turbo Boost sensors (once at 55k miles and again at 97k miles), $600 for Urea tank sensor, $500 for EGR valve and of course the maintenance stuff: $1500 for brakes twice, $600 for non run flat Continental tires twice (got out of my run flat tires fast), host of oil changes, etc. Get out of it before 70,000 miles while you can still get a decent trade in or a private sale.

We bit the bullit in 2010 and ordered ours with all of the options. At the time, there was a hefty rebate on the diesel and a tax incentive of $5k . My wife and I both drive it and it has 66,000 miles. Brakes, tires and a battery is all we have done to it. Regular dealer and good independent service have kept the cost down. You don't buy one of these to save money. You buy it for the driving experience, comfort and safety that the Beemer is famous for. We get about 30 mpg on the highway and 24 in town. I had the dealer install the BMW trailer hitch package and it is worth it. I'll pull a horse or big utility trailer with it easily. The hitch is rated at 6500 lbs, but the same car in europe is rated at 7700 lbs. The hitch kit from the dealer includes an integrated trailer brake system hooked into the computer. They re-program the computer to ""know"" the trailer and lights etc. The shift patterns change when a trailer is hooked up. Pretty good stuff. BMW says the transmission and some other fluids are for life. My mechanic says to change them out at about 80K. I tend to believe him as it makes sense that any fluid will break down over time. Would I buy one again? Absolutely. New? Probably not. Probably get another diesel with under 10K miles on it. They are around and priced well.UPDATE 7/15/2017The repair costs make the car a poor value if you plan on keeping it. We are having lots of problems with the diesel emissions system that are running into several thousand dollars.

I wanted to buy, but everyone told me that I am crazy and that BMWs tend to have lots of problems as soon as the warranties expire.  Is that true? Perhaps not and I am sure how one drives them and cares for them has a lot to do with the issue, but I felt uncomfortable and so I got a high-mileage lease which costs me a lot, true be told. A professional at Honda, during a conversation we had (my second car is a Honda) told me that ""BMW will last, but maintenance does not come cheap!"" That is the real issue: does one want to be stuck in expensive maintenance? Each of us has his or her own answer to this.  IS IT REALLY THE ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE? No. Period. Perhaps, if one gets the X5 M, but the 6-cylinder X5 with 300 hp and 4700 lb of weight is just good for 0-60mph in 6 seconds. Nobody gets overly impressed by that. Visibility is good, but not great and even maniacs who drive in and out of lanes have to pay a lot of attention. Sure, in Sport Mode, it is on the fun side, I will admit to that and on occasions I hit the canyons around here and push it  and have fun, but for everyday use it is not a dream come true.   IS IT COMFORTABLE? The basic seats for me are ugly and as uncomfortable as they get. In fact, my Honda's seats are more comfortable! However I upgraded the seats to the next level (cannot do the top trim as they only come in ivory white which I do not like for my daily ride) and things improved more than a bit.  The rear seats are not bad at all for rear seats, however. Quite good.  DOES IT HANDLE WELL? Yes, it does. That I must admit.. Even at 90mph or more on canyons, the car has an excellent behavior for such heavy vehicle. I have the Dynamic handling package as well though.  OPTIONS. That is the best part about purchasing or leasing a BMW, i.e. most is customizable a la carte unlike other brands in the same segment.  EXPENSIVE TO OWN? As it is a lease and I am under warranty, no. But fuel economy, while good for the segment, is nothing to brag about. I am getting on average 22 mpg. I can get 26mpg on highway alone (mine is the 4 wheel drive model), however in city driving I feel like I want to cry. I am lucky if I get 17 mpg, probably 16 mpg more like it. WOULD I BUY/LEASE IT AGAIN? Tough. Leasing is not my thing, I like the cars to be mine and keep them forever. The warranty program for me is weak. I would like 6 years or 100k miles. If a brand does not do that, to me it means they do not believe in their vehicles as I would like them to. That is at the of the day, my real issue: I am ok to pay more for a vehicle but, if I take care of it, it should hardly ever have any issue. Like my Honda CR-V, 21 years together, 303k miles on it and never a major issue. Fun is good, but reliability is  very desirable as well. HOW WAS IT DEALING WITH BMW DEALERS? Pleasant, surprisingly very pleasant. I am confident that it varies from dealer to dealer, but my experience was A+.  I did rent the car for 4 days before purchasing so I knew how it drives, the positives and the negatives and all I had to do was to select the options I needed/wanted and deal on price. Mine was custom ordered as I am picky on colors and combinations of interiors/exteriors, but dealer worked with me and never rushed me.  WHAT DO I REALLY THINK THE 6 cylinder X5 needs? Either to lose some weight or gain another 50 hp (without fuel consumption go higher), then it would be near perfect.  Brakes could be a bit more powerful too. Stopping this vehicle in tight spaces, is not a breeze. On 405 Freeway, there was an accident in the car pool lane and I was traveling on it... I kept a reasonable distance, but with the delays in braking.. I came within inches of hitting the car in front.  Downhill braking always does not feel very powerful. Other than that, so far thumbs up.",4,2017," BMW X5 SUV xDrive35i 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"
"599",2018-02-19,"DNJ","2017 BMW X5 SUV xDrive50i 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)","50i does not disappoint","I thought I needed the bigger engine. No one NEEDS an SUV with this much power. I find I rarely have the opportunity to use it. Even merging, if I floor it, it's so ferocious I let up on the right foot. With the eight speed transmission, manual shifting mode is not something I utilize much. In sport mode, the computer delivers flawless downshifts. I've owned an X1 35i and 335xi. This SUV is tons faster than either of those very quick cars. Power aside, this car is extremely poised on the road. The ride is the best I've owned, loads better than my new get Volvo xc90 (without air suspension). Steering is numb but in every day driving, I actually appreciate not having to work to turn the wheel. It is a bit scary accelerating in a corner with such little feedback. The car never wanders on the straights, though. Interior quality is the best I've owned in the BMW. I did get the extended leather upgrade. My X1 has some cheap plastics on the pillars and doors. Not the X5 50. Everything feels top notch. I've not had any unwanted noises or noticed anything that doesn't quite fit together right (unlike my volvo xc90). Back seat space is great. I fit my three kids back there just fine. There is more than enough space in the boot, in my opinion. Tech is the sore spot for me. Yes, this car has blind spot and pedestrian detection. The cross traffic detection is just not that handy. You have to be looking at the display for the flashing yellow. There is no audible or tactile feed back so if you are just backing up and not paying attention to the center display, it's pretty useless. Also, really BMW? Not including auto-cruise control at this price point is just stupid. My X5 doesn't have that option. Still, the idrive interface is easy to use. I really appreciate the knob now that my wife has an xc90 where everything is touch. There is touch too which really helps with entering addresses. I think the writing feature on the dial is a gimmick. I never use it. I have the standard harmon kardon sound system. It's just fine. However, my wife has the B&A system on her XC 90 and it does not disappoint. I think it would be worth the extra $$$. Handling is great with xdrive. I live in MN. I put pirelli winter tires on the spare rims I got with the car (mine was optioned with the 21"" M wheels with pirelli p zeros). Compared to my wife's new xc90 with all season tires, there is a definite difference with stopping and starting. Turning is better in the volvo.  The car is more rear wheel biased and xdrive doesn't really help much when turning in snow at least compared to my experiences in other all wheel vehicles. Bottom line: if you are getting an $80,000 plus BMW you probably do care what others think. In the 50i, you know you are going to leave the Q7 and CayenneS drivers in your wake (most cars really). It's very satisfying moving such a large vehicle with such ridiculous acceleration.",5,2017," BMW X5 SUV xDrive50i 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)"

If there is any traffic on the highway they will not activate.Cons: - Biggest disappointment for my 72K car is the engine. Base engine is barely adequate. The 6 cylinder engine will struggle to move the car. I have never had a car that goes over 6000 RPM to the red zone every time I merge to the highway. Do not expect sporty performance.- LED headlight are cool looking, have whiter shade than HIDs, and they may last longer but they are not any brighter than HIDs on other cars. They are not worth the extra money.- The hand break does not engage well. The car will always roll down a few inches after stopping the engine, even in park and engaging the hand break. I park on slightly steep drive and I never with this issue. - The electric shift knob is not precise. You will not feel the shifts. It does not have the secure click like in my Mercedes. I must take my eyes off the road to make sure I am in the right gear, or I will be revving the engine in neutral, or moving when I was supposed to be in neutral. - The button that activate and deactivate auto shut off when stopped is too small and too close to ignition. The problem is that they are both hidden under the steering wheel, you may push both with your thumb if you do not look and then you would have the engine shutoff unexpectedly on the first stop. - The A/C is very weak. I never had to put the A/C on MAX cold in any car before and I do not like strong A/C. It might be fine if you live in the northern states. I live in the south and the A/C will only be fine on cooler days. On hot days, exactly when you need it, it will take 30-minute highway drive on MAX cold to cool off the car. - The blind spot monitor only works on relatively high speed, I believe something like 30 miles/hr. It is not useful in busy slower traffic.- The seats are not comfortable. I have the higher-end seats they can be adjusted in many ways. I can never find them comfortable. - There is a front camera which I was excited to see. I thought it would help to see what is right in front when you park. It is absolutely useless. It will show exactly what you normally see ahead of you without leaning forward. You will not be able to view anything below to hood level.  - Would not recommend low profile tires.

Years later, we found that many diesel versions had reliability issues.    But in terms of all-around ability (ride, handling, acceleration, comfort, utility, towing ability, looks) it was still our favorite 6 years later.  It handles fantastic for such a large heavy vehicle.  You can feel the weight but the huge tires grip like crazy.  The SAV version is definitely the one to get, it looks great, and gives a feeling of confidence in turns and at speed that most others just do not.   Utility is good, not great, with over 70 cu ft of cargo area with seats down.  They don't fold flat, which is disappointing (we have dogs), but there is plenty of room for a road trip with 4 dogs, 2 people, and luggage.   A family of four would do ok.  It can also tow a fairly heavy trailer, but I installed my own hitch and wiring as the BMW version is outrageously expensive.  Took 2 hours, so there's no valid reason for their exorbitant labor charges, as they should be able to do it in half the time.  Ride is firm but not harsh, though big bumps will be felt.   It is a better ride than our Volvo S60 R design sport sedan, but those seeking a luxury smooth ride should look elsewhere.   It is surprisingly quiet for a vehicle like this.  Seat comfort is better for the thin shouldered, as the bolsters do press a little on my broad back at the lats.  The thigh extension is a must-have.  Xenons make visibilty good at night, and there are no blind spots to worry about.   Throttle tip in is actually slower than it should be, you have to punch it to get power in regular transmission mode.  It doesn't seem to be turbo lag (max torque comes in at just 1250 rpm) but a throttle tip in issue.  Acceleration is good, not breathtaking, but more than enough for regular driving, especially at speed.  Handling is very confidence inspiring and curvy mountain roads won't raise the hairs on your back like in most crossovers or SUVs.  Not too far from a sport sedan and better than most mundane sedans.   Very handsome vehicle, materials are good, and our 3 year old example looked practically new.   Many others we looked at didn't fare so well.  We paid $37,000 for one with 34K miles and it still has one year of bumper to bumper and 2 more years of CPO coverage.   With taxes and the hitch we have $39K in it.  It stickered for about $69,000 so that's a nice savings.   It had an airbag recall that was fixed before we got it but otherwise the history was clean.   There was no spare on this one which is unfortunate, but those temp spares are so limited in range and speed that it wasn't of much use anyway on long trips.   The interior design is handsome but not beautiful.  Ergonomics are typical BMW, with a learning curve for some functions like cruise and the computer.  The NAV is useful but like most, not always great.  The iDrive controller is fairly easy to use now and fairly logical, though one can still get screens not doing what you want when choosing the split screen or wanting to display your songs when you are also navigating, etc.   Tons of brake dust, like all BMWs.  But a very solid feeling vehicle and great build quality.  Conceptually this is the closest to a ""does it all"" vehicle that one can find.    Sporty, good looking(in SAV trim), good handling, quiet, reasonable ride quality, safe, spacious, and  reasonable comfort.    My only fix would be to add the luxury comfort seat option, as the sport seats are supportive but a little firm compared to our Volvos.  But anything will be less comfortable than Volvo seats.    Only those who value solid handling and sporty aspirations should bother paying the price, as there are plenty of bigger or more cushy rides available for less.  We just want the confidence it gives at high speed and the active safety of great handling and braking for the class.UPDATE:   Steering is actually over-heavy, in parking situations the wide tires and heavy steering actually make your arms ache while backing a trailer.    It ""feels"" as heavy as it is, and so unless you need the extra space, the X3 is probably a better choice for driving enthusiasts, but really a wagon would be best of all. Unfortunately they make only the 3 series wagon and I find its seats too narrow. The X5 seats are wide.    It's very solid at speed, but not nimble.   UPDATE:   Actually it handles very well, but in a heavy manner.  Ride is for enthusiasts rather than luxury seekers.  Depreciation has been really bad as apparently BMW's reliability and high cost of repairs haunt it.   A good bargain well researched $37K vehicle has a resale value of about $24K after 20 months.

No more BMW!","I bought this X5 eDrive car after my 8-year old Lexus RX350 was totaled and I could not tolerate the new RX350/450h grille front design. Horrible experience started after a July accident, when a towing truck lost control spinning on highway and smashed to my passenger side door. The car was towed to Russel Collision Center in MD, it took them more than THREE months to ""fix"" it after repeated delays and excuses. There were a lot of visible and electronic problems when they said it was ready to be picked up. Then they tried to fixed them over and over. Finally you thought all should be good. Actually the nightmare just started. Over the weekend, I drove to NY. The ""Malfunction - Battery not charging"" message appeared. After contacting the Road Side Assistance (RSA), I decided to continue my trip as the car was moving OK. On my way back Sunday, the same message reappeared a few times before ""Drivetrain Malfunction"" appeared, and the car started shaking with all warning lights on. What a scaring moment on I-83 near York! I managed to stop the car over the shoulder.  I contacted RSA and it took me almost two hours to see a towing truck coming. I had to call a uber to take my family members home first while I was waiting for the tow truck. I thought I would have a safe ride with the towing truck to be back to my dealership. No kidding, the tow truck broke down after about 15 min while the driver was on his handheld phone all the time gossiping. I eventually had to take a uber home. This morning I contacted BMW Catonsville and they confirmed the car was towed there and they were ready to repair it. I was told by Text message, ""looks like we had a programming recall for the vehicle, i believe this squared away all these issues"" (the issues I reported included: Clicking noise, not working hybrid system, seat position button not working, USB phone button won't pick up incoming calls besides the battery not charging and malfunctioning drivetrain, etc.). If there's a serious recall, why the customer was not notified immediately, instead putting my entire family on risk. After I picked up the car this afternoon, the very first thing I noticed was that there's no power to the rear mirror (meaning you cannot program your garage door opener), which they fixed once couple of weeks ago. And the memory seat position button still not functioning. I have no idea how many more issues will be discovered and how much hassle I have to deal with on my busy life schedule.

Only drawback if there is one is the liftback door is split such that the upper 3/4 raises and then you have to lower the bottom 1/4 separately to have it fully open for sliding something larger into the cargo space.

The car accelerated smoothly and reached speed limit very quick. If you put it into any other drive mode and attempt to accelerate quickly, forget it. The twin turbo 4 cylinder is way under power to move this 5000 pound beast. The acceleration also lagged because it has to start up the gas engine and let the turbo build up. By the time everything is ready, the acceleration is delayed by 1 to 2 seconds. And once it's ready, you get a lurch effect. I charged the battery overnight with the supplied 120V cable and it only charged 75% for 12 hours. The manual says 7 hours for a full charge. With only 75% charge, I was unable to test the 14 miles of battery driving. But I have to say that I did get 10 miles from the 75% battery. So I guess that is accurate.

On long trips, you can maximize the Hybrid motor by Coasting and Breaking to recharge the engine to guarantee less fuel usage. Overall performance is fantastic. Though the heaviest of the X5 line you do not see any lag from stop to start with the engine combination. Gas mileage I have experienced in the city with combined driving is 58 mpg and on long trips of 150 miles plus I average 29 mpg. The ride is extremely smooth and I catch myself going a little fast. The heads-up display keep me in check while driving. The interior is beautiful depending on the options you select. I have the Black Dakota Leather and it is beautiful. Seat comfort is fantastic as you have an array of adjustment options for comfort. Navigation is great. The 10 inch plus display makes things very easy to use. The infotainment system is easy to use and navigate thru while driving. The exterior is beautiful. Dual exhaust and the traditional BMW kidney grill topped off with the high quality paint options makes the X5 a no brainier for someone looking for a new SUV.

Keep in mind that this is big vehicle so quick is a relative, but in true BMW fashion the car will get you up to 80mph+ without you even being aware even in city traffic. However, there is a noticeable lag from the turbo and gas mileage borders on atrocious for this day and age when driven even just modestly aggressive.  With that said, it's quiet and smooth at speeds of even over 100mph. The I-Drive is far better than the old days and better than any I've used. Also, the rear seats fold down which increases the utility greatly and was one of the reason I decided to buy this model. The interior quality is among the best, although taller drivers and passengers will need to watch their heads as the car is low and wide both inside and out.So you get a gorgeous car, room for large items in the back (especially with the rear seats folded) as well as a wonderful touring car with front seats that will make your time in the car very comfy. All this for a mere $90K or so....  And that's where the rub is for me. Despite being treated with the M badging and upgraded package, my in line 6 cylinder still lacks fairly basic items like blind spot detection, intuitive cruise control, lane keep, upgraded stereo and the one that drives me crazy, a power trunk. The power trunk is not even an option, but adding these other items along with the accompanying, required packages and you're approaching $100K. In addition, I had to pay extra via aftermarket hack to have simple things like mirrors fold with remote, windows down with remote, auto engine shutoff disabled. Seems to me that even for the messily $87K that my car cost new it should really have these items. I am pretty sure the same year Honda Accord has more amenities. I mean, come on BMW.

It came out of Beverly Hills, California (checked the iDrive locations) and was in pristine condition. It was on a 36 month lease and I found it after it was traded in after the lease expired...they drove it less than 7K/year. Thank you very much. Sticker was pushing $50,200 new. Ouch. I paid $20K less. I live in Portland, Oregon and it is a weekend play toy...I have an AWD SUV for work and outdoor pursuits. Even so, I ripped off the run flats and added Michelin tires that are superb in dry and wet. Better tires all the way around and handling that sticks like glue and has a great ride. Have AAA if I ever get a flat, with a 200 mile tow, included. I wanted the 135i before the 2 series appeared with electric steering and 4 cylinder engines...I have had numerous BMW's before and there is nothing like hydraulic steering...and it's all too rare these days. The steering feel is a pleasure and the ride is terrific for this sized vehicle. People seem to be out of touch these days with the pleasure of driving. Sure, there's nothing wrong at all getting from point A to B in a huge  Chevy Suburban...but if you really love to drive, fewer and fewer cars really fit that bill, but this is sure one of them. The car is a little rocket and being fast and little, I don't mention mpg or luggage room because that is not the purpose of this car, at least for me.  Heck, small sports cars are not meant to be super practical...just super fun and are there for the smiles per mile...and this car delivers. The inline 6 is magnificent...I have added a few things to make it even more enjoyable and have boosted the already powerful engine output to almost 380 hp/400 ft-lbs. torque with a simple chip tune. I've added a few more accessories from BMW and all work is done by BMW certified mechanics, so I have expectations that as well as I care for it, it will take care of me for years to come. Overall, it is among my favorite cars to drive, ever...this and my past BMW V-8 powered 550, which was a bullet disguised as a sedan. BMW's just drive very well. They are fun, stable as can be and very solid on the road. Sure, they don't have the reliability as my girlfriend's Lexus, or the super comfy ride...but when she first drove my 135i, her first comment was ""Holy cow, this is a car...and what a pleasure to drive this thing.""  She does think it's a rather interestingly proportioned car and I agree. I think it's kind of funny looking but I don't buy a car just on looks alone in any way, shape or form. Various factors/criteria are always sought and this one makes my heart beat every time I get in it.  I initially looked at Porsche Cayman (too pricey), Infiniti G37 (Japanese BMW copy for less money...no real passion), and the Audi TT (boring). I was seeking a vehicle 2-3 years old, in great condition and fun...I found at least one of each of these cars somewhat meeting that criteria but the BMW was my favorite by far and the one  that I drove away in. They say BMW lost their way a few years ago trying to move from a company that sold driving machines to just selling cars to as many people as possible...in the process, they lost purists who love to drive. Numerous articles spoke of this car being their attempt to get back to what they did best in the past...I have to agree.

What a difference! Double the hp + tighter suspension equaled serious handling upgrade and BMW options/refinement make the car much more daily driver user friendly.  Surprisingly, the soft top is as quite as my SUV on the hwy and ten times quieter than the Miata's hardtop.  Tiny backseats are perfect for my small kids but are barely useable for normal adults.  Truck is more than adequate for grocery runs and can hold full size suitcases in a pinch. Outward visibility is great, top up or down.  Exhaust sounds awesome under acceleration but is quiet at cruising speeds.  M Sport package gives the car an aggressive appearance.  I do miss shifting the gears in the 6 spd. manual of the Miata but the DCT transmission of the BMW is a close approximation and is more wife/valet friendly.

It's a high performance coupe, expect it to be low and have small back seats.  You knew this when test driving it and it was YOUR choice!  It's not the cars fault you didn't pay attention.That being said, the 2009 135i 6 speed manual is an absolute beast.  Not to mention they are quite rare on the east coast so people notice a nice one.  I'm a male in my late 20's and I've had this car for 4 years.  This car is a rocket and handles like nothing I've ever driven.  The 2009 comes with the twin turbo N54 engine which is the best part.  It's practically the same engine that is in the new 2015 M3!  Just putting a chip in the car increases horsepower by 80-100HP to the wheels!  When I bring this car to the track, I leave M class BMW's in the dust.  After a few modifications this is actually the fastest car I have ever been in.Power aside, the trunk is quite large and the back seats fold down.  I fit a brand new 55 inch TV (still in the box) into this car.  I've also fit 4 brand new 18 inch rims/tires!  You'd be surprised on how much this car can fit!  I also have my friends in the back seats all the time with no complaints.  The issue is that the driver and passenger tend to have their seats further back than needed and don't realize it!I can honestly say that this car is the greatest thing I have ever purchased.  If you are in a similar situation as me, don't have kids, and like a beautiful interior/exterior with insane power.  Look no further.  One quick note:Run flat tires come standard on this car and it makes the car drive stiffer due to the sidewalls of the tires being harder.  If you replace them with regular tires (which are way cheaper in price) you'll find it drives much differently.  I prefer the regular tires and I'm willing to accept the risk.

I sold the car last fall, and I'm not sorry to have parted company with it.  I got tired of the occasionally harsh ride and uncomfortable seats.

But the Sensatech seats and door material on the 128i look cheap, and the black shiny plastic in place of the wood grain or titanium trim is just plain tacky. The 330ci felt like a luxury vehicle. The 128i feels like an entry-level Hyundai or something. I actually just sold a Hyundai Genesis 2.0T Premium, which had keyless entry, keyless start, universal remote, moonroof, nice trim, automatic dimming mirrors and good bolstered seats. It cost about $24k new. The base 128i has NONE of those things, and cost over $33k new. Yes, the driveability is much better than a Genesis (but noticeably worse than a 330ci). The gas mileage is worse than both of these other vehicles.  Overall I'm not overly impressed with the 1 series.

This is not turbo lag--the car simply will not move--you can have the gas pedal floored and it feels as if the car shut off--nothing happens for a few seconds, which is scary in some situations.  I took it to the dealer and they kept it for a week trying to fix it--they got it improved slightly, but it is still not fixed.

I drove this car from Colorado to Palm Springs, CA, shortly after my purchase, and was just amazed at its performance and handling. I traded in a Porsche Panamera 4S (2012) and that was a great car, designed (I think) with my demographic in mind. I'm 75 years old.

The BMW organization practically fawns over me as a buyer of its top-priced sedan, and I guess I like that. I also really like the full maintenance warranty, so - unlike Porsche-Audi's ""turn"" over the last few years with their very costly maintenance services, I pay for nothing; although I'd guess it's in the price of the vehicle.Especially at Palm Springs altitude - sometimes UNDER sea level - with all the O2 that location provides, the power of this vehicle with its twin-turbo engine, is astounding. And to my great surprise, my mileage, off the vehicle's computer, was averagiing 30.2 mpg from Boulder to Palm Springs - 1050 miles. Huh? Incredible.And the car's comfortable and ultra-luxurious interior is a pleasure to experience, and the various optional handling levels (suspension, throttle response, shift points) provide varied driving experiences which are a real kick to play with. At my home in Colorado, I live in the mountains overlooking Boulder, and at 8000 feet, the car still runs like a 'Vette - and there are many twists and turns on the roads leading from my Boulder home to Boulder-City, 2400 feet below my front door.If you want ultimate luxury and incredible power and handling, consider this car - the AWD Xdrive is a huge plus for my home area, and so far, it has operated flawlessly. My current miles put on this car add up to just over 4000 road miles, and I hope it runs and handles as well as it currently does, for another 30-40K miles, before my next car must be selected!",5,2016," BMW 7 Series Sedan 750i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)"

I would have opted for the Alpina B7 had it been avail but due to timing I opted for a 750i xDrive.  Although not quite as fast as the much more expensive Benz I traded, this car is far more engaging and athletic to drive. The 4.4L V-8 is silky smooth and the transmission programming is spot on. On a car with as much technology as these high-end sedans have, I much prefer the interfaces and user-friendliness of BMW's approach to controls, infotainment, and gizmos (exception of the seat controls.... MBZ has the best placement for seat controls).  The drive settings provide a cadre of options ranging from pillow soft to firm. Perhaps I haven't discovered how yet but I'd like the car to stay in the mode I last drove it in (defaults to comfort every time I start it up). In all drive settings the car performs admirably on road trips over varied pavement. I do notice more dramatic pitch from the front suspension than I am used to in a BMW under hard braking or hard acceleration.  I don't opt for the 21"" wheels based on other's reviews that they are overly harsh. I am running the 20"" M-Sport 5-Spoke wheels on Pirelli Run-Flats and they seem to be a good compromise. I am sure, as with all other BMW's I've owned, performance comes partly at the price of accelerated tire wear. This being a long wheelbase all-wheel drive 7-series, I expect 12-15K miles out of a set of tires tops....  The Bowers & Wilkins Stereo is worth the coin and far superior to the top of the line Burmester Audio in the Benz (Speakers in my AMG were poorly designed/installed and housings began resonating badly very soon after purchase). My initial impressions on the new 7 series are positive and my hope is I still enjoy my seat time in this car in year 2, 3, and beyond. I believe BMW's biggest strengths in this segment are in it's general user-friendliness of high end features and general quality implementation and refinement of all systems. For me, BMW has done a far superior overall job to MBZ and Audi and worth noting, Tesla (Sorry Tesla, If I want to open my sunroof, I don't want to browse through menus on a big screen to get there....).",4,2016," BMW 7 Series Sedan 750i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)"

We have lots of snow where we live so we are considering those cars and the Mercedes model that is ""snow worthy""  So far we have test driven the Audi A8, V6 and V8 models and the BMW 7 Series V8.  We much preferred the V8 Audi over the V6 so we did not bother testing a V6 in the BMW.  We have not yet driven the Mercedes.  We have not decided on a car yet.  While both cars were fun to drive, we liked the driving and handling of the BMW better than the Audi.  We also liked the trunk space in the BMW.  But the interior of the Audi was more luxurious than the BMW and the ride more comfortable for long distances.  The front seats in the Audi are also a little wider.  We are smaller people and don't need such wide seats, but if you are a bigger person, that might make a difference for you.  The camera and navigation screen in the BMW is much clearer than in the Audi.  We thought that Audi has a little ""catching up"" to do with the technology.  There are rumors of a new Audi being launched this fall.  If the navigation screen and the trunk size were comparable to the BMW, we would pick the Audi.  Perhaps the Mercedes will change our minds on both. We don't know that yet.  We found the leasing structure of the cars interesting.  While we can purchase the Audi for about $10,000 less than the BMW, the lease payments are the same for both cars, making the residual value of the BMW about $25,000 more than the Audi should we want to buy it at the end of the lease.

The odometer reads 8,895 miles.  The vehicle actually drives and handles even better than when I first bought the car back in December, 2016.  I am averaging 21 mpg city, 36 mpg highway and 25 mpg combines highway/city.  Remember, this is the inline 6 cylinder turbo delivering 320 hp and 335 lb ft of torque.  The engine is more powerful and responsive that one would expect out of a 6 cylinder configuration - but with the turbo boost, the car accelerates rapidly even at 55 mph.  It seems to have tremendous torque throughout most of the RPM range (1900 rpm - 5500 rpm).  It has taken me many months to master all the technology offered in this vehicle - especially the drive settings (Sport, Comfort, Comfort Plus, EcoPro, and Adaptive.  Most of the time, I keep the car in either EcoPro, as it is the most fuel efficient setting, or in Comfort.  I rarely press the Sport mode as it is the least fuel efficient.  I've driven from Ft. Lauderdale to just south of Jacksonville, FL and back twice since I've owned the car.  Most of the driving is at 70-75 mph and the distance is 300 miles each way.  The car rides and handles beautifully.  I especially like the Adaptive Cruise and Self-Steering modes as it makes the drive much more comfortable, not to mention safe.  Another feature I have really enjoyed is the 360 degree camera angles when parking the car.  Here in South Florida, we do not have much in the way of parallel parking - most is just pull-in parking with a parking stoop in the front of the car.  I use the 360 degree cameras so I pull into the parking spaces straight rather than at an angle.  The sound system is magnificent, especially when listening to FM HD music stations or DVD's.  I use Apple Car Play all the time and it streamlines Bluetooth calling, text messages received and readouts of those text messages.I usually buy a new car every year but I have no intention trading this one any time soon.  This one is a keeper!The only problem I have had with the car was with ""inadvertent trunk opening""!  After bringing it in the dealership twice, they said one sure-fire solution to this anomaly is to reprogram the car's computer so that the trunk cannot be opened with the key fobs unless the car doors are unlocked first.  So we did that and I have no more inadvertent trunk opening problems.  I still can open the trunk without the key fob by moving my foot under the rear bumper or by pressing the trunk release just above the license plate frame.  So this is a minor inconvenience - having to unlock the car before using the trunk release button on the key fob - but it has not affected any other trunk operations.I do not know when I will be in the market for another new car, but I am sure it won't be for a few years and I am sure it will be another BMW 7 series.  For the money, it is the very best large passenger sedan built.  Sure, the Mercedes S Class sedan is a great vehicle, but in my opinion, not worth the $15,000+ more than the 740i with all options.I still recommend that if you buy one of these vehicles, that you make sure you add the Driver's Assistance Package, the Driver's Assistance Plus Package, the Executive Package and the Parking Assistance Package for the 360 degree camera views.  I also recommend the 19"" wheels.  Remember, the car comes with run-flats so you have no jack or spare tire.  If I had to do it all over again, I probably would not get the run-flats if I could and would add 19"" Summer Performance Tires.  I believe it would produce a better ride with better handling.Still the best car I've ever owner or driven!!!",5,2017," BMW 7 Series Sedan 740i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

The 'swipe-or-twirl-to-change' feature should never have been developed or added; it's stupid, and BMW could have spent that $$ to standardize their collision-avoidance tech or hardware. The hot-spot works well depending on your carrier, I guess. No, the car doesn't handle or track like an E-30, but this is a big sedan and I don't think the people that buy the 7s are too concerned with how fast it hustles around COTA or the 'Ring. That's why you buy an M3. This car will provide a quiet, smooth ride for hundreds of miles at any speed you are comfortable driving. It is amazingly quiet and smooth at triple digits. I lease this vehicle, so maintenance and warranty and resale are not an issue for me. I think the car looks great as well. The car is well-proportioned and the styling is distinctive but subtle. I don't like the designs from Benz or Lexus or Cadillac and would not drive any of them. The interior is well laid-out and there are buttons and knobs for just about everything. There is a lot of technology and swiping if you want to use it, but you don't have to. Head-up display is better than just a couple of years ago. The lane position feature takes a little getting used to, but it is helpful and you can turn it off if you find it too obtrusive. Driving position is very adjustable and my 5-2 wife can get comfortable while my 6-1 self can also find a good driving position. Transmission is good and you have to pay attention to notice the shift points. Steering is light and road feedback is minimal, but again, if you want a track car, get an M2 or M3. The run-flats on this vehicle are surprisingly good despite the low profile and width. There's really only one thing that I wish BMW would add, and that is an audible alert (and a popup on the HUD) when one of your favorites comes up on satellite radio. Value is subjective. My dad sees cars as appliances and drives a wonderful Honda and loves it. On the other hand, he wears Hickey Freeman suits where I wear what find on sale at Dillard's. I am very happy with the car I have and I'm willing to pay what it costs for this level of comfort, quiet and performance.

I have 5000 miles on it now. It is a FANTASTIC car. It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 & 1 to Santa Monica  that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!!  For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation.  I've lowered the car 3/4"" front and back. Put Niche rims on and went to 305's on the back from the stock 285's. It is one....... Sweet.........car. My 2 business partners have opted for coupes.

The more I drive it the less I like it. As many professional reviewers have noted, the engine sounds really unpleasant. The shifter can be infuriating esp. changing between forward and reverse is very slow and requires the driver to engage the brake pedal for a significant amount of time. The navigation system is laughable (in the age of Google Maps). Sometimes I still use it but don't put your car in reverse after you entered your destination. The backup camera will come on and wipe out your destination entry. As for the backup camera: horrible contrast and low light performance (where does BMW even buy such low quality components). One of the most annoying things is that you cannot lock the car when you park it in Neutral (hard to believe but true). You have to turn the engine back on and put it in Drive, then get back out and lock it.

I ended up picking this mainly because I wanted a hard-top convertible with some power.  This car drives great, is comfortable, and great with the top down.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase but am a little annoyed by some things that don't make sense to me, a lot related to difficult function controls.  I've only had it about a month so part of this might be just adjusting to BMW ways.  First of all, it isn't possible to put this car into PARK without turning off the car.  So weird and annoying if you want to be SURE that it is in PARK.  It switches to park automatically if turning off the car in Drive or Reverse, but otherwise you can only put it into NEUTRAL and set the parking brake if you want to sit idle, or turn it off and turn it back on.  Also, the lack of touch for the screen interface is inefficient for entering addresses, and the finger spelling on the console control knob is not a good replacement--much easier to tap out a number on a screen than trace each individual number/letter.  Also, the volume control is only on the dash or on the right side of the steering wheel--this means if you have your hand on the console knob controlling your nav/media, driving with your left hand, you have to move your right hand from the console knob to the dash or the steering wheel.  The car has options for comfort suspension for daily driving but there isn't a way to make that a default--it always goes back to the more rigid SPORT option so that you have to reselect each time you start the car for COMFORT.  There are other little things like the toggle for the hard-top requires you to pull BACK to put the top UP/Forward, and push Forward to put the top down/back -- just not intuitive.  LOTS of media options but difficult to sort out.  Anyway, I'll stop with these things since overall it's a very nice car with AMAZING driving profile, which is what most people might be looking for and the little things might not matter.  It's my primary car so the daily use things are a little annoying to me.  As far as hard-topped convertible with power, I think this is the only good choice.

Bought the six-cylinder version not because of the added power but because there is no comparison in smoothness.  Incredibly smooth power with great brakes and handling.  Nice styling and finishing, as one should expect.  Beautiful, comfortable interior although the leather in the driver's seat developed a wrinkle across the back TWICE until BMW finally had an upholsterer add additional attachments (I'm 6-4 and 190, so it's not my weight).  Stereo, navigation, and bluetooth work easily for me, although it would be better yet if you could get both the birdseye view and the rearview camera view on the same screen.What ruins the situation is the LOUSY manner in which BMW treated me over a $100 repair.  One (1) wheel developed black spots that leached through the paint and left streaks.  The other three wheels were/are perfect because I am obsessive about cleanliness.  The dealer tried to remove the spots with solvent and instead removed the silver paint and left the black spots.  They referred me to the Regional Representative, who declared the spots to be ""probably tar,"" not even ""definitely tar"" -- how can they say that when solvent takes off the paint and leaves the spots, and there's not a spot of tar on any of the other three wheels?  And to make matters worse, I waited a month for that appointment and then sat there for two hours to discuss the problem, and he totally blew me off.  Upon learning what he had written on the repair order, the dealer offered to goodwill half of the $100 repair bill.  I refused because it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing.  It's bad paint, cover it under the *(&^ warranty!  I then elevated this to BMW NA, where things went from bad to worse.  They ignored my complaint for weeks, didn't return phone calls, and didn't respond to followup e-mails.  Finally a ""Resolution Specialist"" rudely told me that they didn't know what caused the problem, but it wasn't covered by the warranty.  So I asked him -- do you mean all everyone from BMW that I've spoken to so far have been WASTING MY TIME when it wasn't even covered by the warranty?  He said yes.  He couldn't tell me where it said this in the warranty book (paint defects are not excluded, road damage is), so I wrote a letter to the President of BMW NA.  A lady responded and looked into it, but the result was that they would ""goodwill"" the entire repair.  This is better but I'm not satisfied because they still won't tell me why it's not covered under the warranty, and there has been no apology for the bad information, wasting my time (if it's really not covered), or the delays or misinformation.  Oh, for my ""goodwill"" the repair -- I was told to speak to a specific person at the dealer -- who has thus far refused to return my phone call for four days.  BMW, if you're listening, your car is great but I'll never buy another because of the way you treat your customer over a $100 repair.

I had a fabulous 328i which I drove for 16 years with almost no failures/repairs.  My 3-year old 435i with 2WD and 6-speed manual is fun to drive, comfortable, great looking and overall a pretty good car.  with just miles my car has been back to the dealer twice for repairs.  The ""computer"" that controls the fancy electronic dashboard needed to be replaced because if could no longer connect via the AT&T 2G network - which no longer exists.  And then just a week later, that new control unit failed and needed to be replaced again. Despite being advertised as getting just 25-28 mpg, I am finding that I get about 28 mpg in the city, and 32 mpg on the highway (driving at a steady 79 mph).  The manual transmission clearly helps me on gas mileage.However:  the BMW I-drive controls for the audio system are pretty sad. When getting back into the car, the display screen will never be the same as previous.  This means you will always have to press buttons to return to the display you want to see.  (I wonder how long before those buttons wear out...... Probably just after warranty expires!)  And every time you use the car you will need to turn up the audio volume again.  Stupid.stupid.stupid.   But worst of all is that the logic behind the operation of the audio..... Well, it just defies all intuitive logic!As much as I love manual transmissions, I doubt that I will buy another BMW with this crummy electronic control system.Another complaint:  Run-flat tires.  These are noisy, harsh-riding, expensive, and are already more than half worn-out after just 14000 miles.   I intend to replace them with standard type tires.

If you are into luxury and do not care about fun in driving or if your budget is limited then search for a lower class cars.... (some new kia cars looks more luxurious from inside than my BMW, but driving and controlling is none compared to BMW)......BTW, if you have a family with big dudes (6'1 and above), then rear seating might become an issue.....",5,2016," BMW 4 Series Coupe 428i SULEV 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

Great handling and acceleration. Really nice transmission. A dream car on country roads. Took it up to Vermont on backroads and couldn't stop smiling. Quite and smooth on highways. Usually drive it in Sport mode - which makes a noticeable difference. The rear seat is big enough for adults, especially around town or for an hour or so. The 2016 model has so many great standard features. We don't care about GPS because we use our iPhones, so we didn't get that package. Just added heated seat/steering wheel.

I narrowed my results to the Porsche Boxster or a BMW (4 Series or up...bigger guy).  I choose the BMW based on consumer and expert reviews, the hardtop opposed to soft top, and I love the four year no hassle warranty/service with these cars.  I may have went for the 6 cylinder (435i) because I prefer the power (as in past BMWs) but my wife owns a newer 328i and when in sport mode, I'm satisfied. Same case here - I have all the packages except cold weather (does have heated seats) including the 'M' package. More active suspension and acceleration....handles great.  Setting the level here though...this vehicle has so much technology that after reading the manual a couple of times, I still had a few questions for the dealership.  I'm a technology professional by trade so that appeals to me but for the non-tech types, the technology and/or communications package may be overkill since you'll probably never use the services.  My parents own an X5, are not tech savvy and barely use all the features available...just a point to consider. Overall, I'll probably drive BMWs for a very long time because I trust the product and the backend support/service.  One more note - I live in Central Florida so the chance to ride topless is pretty much year round hence desiring a convertible.Update 7/2018 -  Resale value used to be very good, e.g. 70% or higher after two years. Imagine my surprise when researching my $63,000 ride (all packages are included), I had a depreciation by over 50% in two years (with less than 5500 miles...yes 5500). I could purchase a 2018 new for what I paid for my 2016. As much as I love BMWs, I'll be looking at a Porsche Panamera next.  Yes, more expensive but the resale is highest for sport sedans. Too bad but I think BMW flooded the market with the ones and twos thus hurting resale values. If this doesn't bother you, I love the car and you should be happy if purchasing or leasing; even a CPO seems like a better deal if purchasing.

I traded in a 2013 Audi A6 and 2008 Porsche Boxster for this car, trying to get a combination that best reflected those 2 cars combined.  The BMW is not a sports car, nor is it intended to be, but it has the feel of one!  It is by far the quietest convertible I have owned, measured both by top up and down.  The wind reflector really helps, but it only works with people in the front seats.  The back seats are ""adequate"" for adults around town, but not for long trips.  The heated neck ventilator is wonderful anytime it is below 68 degrees.  I deeply value a strong sound system, particularly with the top down, and the Harman Kardon system does not disappoint.  We have taken several 7 hour plus trips, and it is very comfortable on the long trips, top up or down.  The engine and transmission are smooth and powerful, and they are more than 90% of the owners would ever want or need.  I loved my 2005 BMW, but this car is much sleeker, with a larger and more comfortable interior.  The trunk and fold down rear seat are outstanding with the top up, and more that adequate when down.  We comfortably took a week long trip to the beach with beach chairs and top down, which you couldn't do in most hard top convertibles.   I have the following criticisms:  1)  A luxury convertible should have available ventilated seats, and they are NOT an option, 2)  the navigation and sound system are not as intuitive or efficient as in the Audi, and 3)  the climate control is not fully automatic, it requires you to manually adjust the fan's speed and vent direction.  Overall, these are minor detractors, but changes BMW needs to make in this car.

It was time for a ""life-style"" car.  We wanted a convertible but, it had to be a hard-top for city parking and, to deal with our snow, we wanted either front wheel drive or awd.  When we saw this car at a car show it 'spoke' to us on an emotional level and it had those important features.  There aren't too many hard-top convertibles anymore; the EOS is on the way out, the Volvo C70 is history as is the Chrysler 200 hard-top.  The Lexus has zero trunk space even with the top up, and the Z4 and SLK are rear wheel drive.  The 428 x drive 'vert is just about perfect!  We decided to take delivery at the SC Performance Center near Greenville and it was a spectacular experience.  They let us drive their cars at high speeds, on a slalom course, on an off-road course, and, most impressively, on a skid pad that dramatically demonstrated the anti-skid program that prevented spin out.  Amazing!  Our car was dramatically delivered (and programmed) in perfect condition and we then took a 1500 mile road trip through the Outerbanks and mountains.  Over that distance, the car gave us ~31 mpg on 89 octane gas in ECO mode.  It's true that that hard top does take up trunk space but, we were able to easily carry two carry-on suitcases that allowed the top to be lowered.  (Our extra debris ended up on the small back seat.)  With the top down, the included wind blocker installed and the windows up we were able to easily talk without any buffeting.  Our local dealer has been extremely solicitous on price, and they threw in winter BMW mats, caps and usb charger.  We're very satisfied!Update:  We've now owned the car about a year and a half.  It continues to greatly please us.  Not a rattle, squeak or issue with anything.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product.  This is a premium car!Update:  We're now about three years into this car and we have about 30K miles on it.  Other than having to pay for rotating the tires we continue to have no issues.

Now lets compare the two cars! 1) When you turned on your 135i in the morning in your garage your knuckles grew fuzzy and your voice dropped an octave....that engine woke up!  And it woke up every fat American in your little town! When the 425 wakes up.....it's like drinking a cup of DD....it's ""coffee""....it's not ESPRESSO! 2) When you sat IN the 135i YOU SAT IN THE 135...I had the cheap fake black leather seats that were THE BEST SEATS I had ever sat in in my entire life! Everyone who ever sat in my car said the same thing...""HOLY HELL"" I now sit in the 425 xi with it's heated leather seats.....at 210lb i'm a ""skinny"" American and well this thing is as wide as a mom jeans wearing woman from Iowa who has a thing for mayo and stuffing and kale is the name of her bff not something you have in a salad. it has ""bolsters"" as in someone said they were there but well these seats are as flat as Kansas. You can manspread all you want in this car to hold your 140oz bladder buster from DD. 3) Transmission...I went from a 6 speed 3 pedal machine that switched gears like a sniper taking out rolly pollies at your local piglywigly to a 8 speed (really 8!) automatic / sport transmission that really thinks it's connected to an inline 6 with two turbos rather than the 2L 4 caned handbag that sits under the hood. But that said the fit and finish on the new to me 2017 is actually good! the IDrive doesn't wish to take us though the rougher parts of town to pick up copious amounts of narcotics and start bare knuckle fist fights like my old 135 use to do...and having an AWD car is nice.....but what would you know...you just Uber Eat's a bucket of KFC with extra mashed potatoes and coleslaw with extra mayo from down the street! So over all very nice car, very well assembled and in white it actually looks very good during sunrise and sunset...has some very nice lines that just seem to show up and make you smile much like my old 135i did. The 2L turbo is a nice engine and the 8 speed transmission is nice when you drive it and push it past 3k rpm. But here is the deal if you had a 6Cyl BMW before and are thinking of saving the world and going with the 4..........don't....it's just not worth it........I'm not saying i'll sell this car tomorrow and upgrade to the 6....i'll learn how to grow up and be an ""adult"" and maybe i'll even grow to actually be able to take a sip of DD and not spit it out and scream ""YOU CALL THIS COFFEE!"" but honestly ........ going from the 135i to the 425xi is like........well......how can I put it......my little 135i with it's OZ racing wheels use to get little kids to point and go ""oooooohhhh"" while my 425xi with it's stock wheels and it's quiet engine gets cougars to look over and go ""oh my!"" now you may be into cougars.......and you may also like to drink DD and stuff your face with a pumpkin filled twice fried fritter.....and that's ok.....but maybe you should have bought a Chevy?

Long sexy lines, low and wide stance, long drop hood and long sloping rear.  The new inline 6 cylinder engine is a major refinement for what is probably the most successful sport sedan/coupe in automotive history.  When you start the car, it gives you a heart pumping exhaust note.  Not obnoxiously throaty, but simply exudes power.  The 8 speed auto transmission is silky smooth as a BMW should be, easily shifts down when power is needed.  Handling is tight and controlled, the low and wide stance coupled with nearly even weight balance front to rear means this car can corner almost anything. You really appreciate the extra torque when you punch it on the highway, no hesitation, just presses you into the back of the seats.  Awesome.  I have owned three BMWs and the technology is finally catching up.  The new iDrive version is intuitive and much quicker than earlier versions.  I actually use the voice commands; they are intuitive and much easier to use than in past.  I particularly like the connected drive app to send destinations from my iPhone to the Nav system in the car so when I get in, my destination is ready to go.  I also like that Pandora and Amazon music are fully integrated to the app so I can stream music directly through the car and dump SiriusXM once the free trial is over. The front sport seats are super comfortable and adjustable, while the back seat is not really usable for adults (short trips only).  It's a 2-door coupe, I didn't buy it for the rear seats.  I'm 6'-2"" and very comfy in the cockpit.  Ok, for the not so great - for 2017 BMW changed their included maintenance to only 3 yrs 36k miles which means three oil changes.  No more wiper blades, you have to buy a $600 upgrade to get wiper blades in the first 36k and another boat load of cash to extend the maintenance another year.  It's a real downgrade for buyers and makes BMW much less attractive to own.  If you have a 36 month lease, this doesn't affect you.  I have the same complaints as everyone else - run flat tires suck, are expensive to replace and harsh to ride on, the electronic steering is mushy compared to the old days although every car comes with it these days, because the suspension is taught the ride can be harsh especially on crappy Northeastern roads.  It is a great car, pure joy to drive, sexy and powerful.

My first was a 2008 328i. This new 2017 430i convertible is a very nice car with some improvements over the 2008 model but some disappointments also. First the good news. The 2 liter 4 cylinder dual turbo engine should satisfy most drivers. It has great pick up and is perfectly mated to the 8 gear auto transmission and greats 25% better fuel economy than my old 2008. The fit and finish is excellent and I feel confident this car will be just as reliable and trouble free as the 2008. The navigation is excellent, as is the voice commands. Gets it right 99% of the time. Now the bad news. After 9 years I expected a few more improvements.  The standard sport seats (which I had on my previous car) give great back support but are definitely too firm on the bottom portion of the seat. The blinkers on the side view mirrors are a nice touch, but are distracting at night. The dashboard layout is very familiar, but also a bit dated. For some crazy reason BMW decided to move the cruise control from a stalk behind the steering wheel to buttons on the steering wheel and in the process remove the power button for the radio from the steering wheel. I use the radio everyday. I rarely use the cruise control. The steering is lighter, but I think a bit too light. Brakes are also a bit too soft, compared to my 2008.

The M2 has phenomenal power and handling and it is a relative bargain too. The manual transmission is a joy to use in daily driving.  The clutch pedal feels light and the engine has so much torque that you can easily skip gears. Unless you are tracking the car you don’t need to hit every gear when you accelerate. It’s not unusual for me to start in first gear, move to 2nd and then shift to 4th then 6th gear. The car comes pretty much fully loaded with only a couple of available options. Compare the loaded MSRP of the M2 to a comparably equipped M235i. They are nearly identical in MSRP. So what do you get in the M2 that you don’t get in the M235i?  You get more power, better brakes, wider tires and better performance. The M2 also comes with a standard limited slip differential which is a $2,700 accessory on the M235i. M2 fuel mileage is about 24 MPG in my daily driving and I get 29 MPG on long highway trips. One thing to note, the suspension is stiff and it is not adjustable like it is on the M235i.

As far as reliability goes, i never had a problem.  it always started and stopped, and ran like it should.  My problems were the crazy electronics and dealer handling.   1st problem--it has automatic rain sensing wipers, but unlike other cars with automatic wipers, you have to manually turn them on every time so they will  work.  so they should be called manual wipers.   2nd problem--the parking sensors have to be manually turned on every time when parking.   they automatically turn on when backing up, but if you are parking they don't come on unless you turn them on every time.   if you are used to sensors that are automatic on other makes of cars, you can hit something thinking the sensors are working when they are not.  3rd problem.  the tire pressure monitors freak out with any change of temperature and when they do, you have to take it to the dealer to get them to reset it(this happens about once every week in oklahoma or so).  you will get sick of going to the dealer because you cant reset it yourself and it wont let  you go into sport mode with a tire error.   it also over rides the backup camera and you can be backing up and the camera will shut off to warn you about the tires which can lead to an accident.  4th problem. 5th problem--while the phone connects automatically (with a long delay) to the car, it often wont connect the audio so you have to go in every time to manually turn it on.   this is about 5 screens into a menu. this occurs about 90% of the time  6th problem.   the audio never remembers where you left it tuned.   it will start up in stations i never listen to or settings that i don't use.  i bought it new so these are not the previous owners settings.  7th problem   the car on several occasions opened all the windows and sunroof over night(twice when it rained) for no reason.  not a pleasant thing to wake up to.  8th problem--the tailgate can be opened on the remote while in drive.  if you put a key in your pocket or purse and it bumps the tailgate button, it can open on you while driving.   this has happened numerous times at stoplights and drive-thrus and will freak you out and make you get out of the car to shut it manually as a risk of getting run over at a stop light.  9th problem--the run flat tires cannot be fixed, only replaced.   they also wear out extremely fast on the X3 you will get about 25k miles before they have to be replaced.   the 650 only gets 15k miles between replacements.  you have no spare or place to store one so switching to better tires that are not run flats leave you with no spare if you do get a flat  10th problem   too many things are settings in the i-drive system.  the system is cumbersome and very menu heavy and not intuitive.  you have to go through menu after menu when it would be better to have more things on one page and less page changing.  11th problem  you have to use the i drive button to accept terms and conditions every time you start the car if you want to use anything on the nav screen.   starting my car is a process.   i have to hit ok to the disclaimer that will pop up every time i start the car.  then wait for the tire pressure monitor warning to come on so i can clear that screen, then i have to go 5 screens into the radio menu to turn the audio from my phone back on(it doesn't work every time and sometimes i have to switch back and forth between radio and bluetooth several times for it to switch on.  then i am ready to drive.   i have timed this and it takes about 2.5 minutes on average. if you don't think this is a long time try waiting in your car for 2.5 minutes while having a someone honking at at you because he wants your parking space  12th problem--when i first got the car i could turn the car off and it would automatically put the car in park for me.   after a software upgrade from the dealer, the car will freak out if i don't place it in park before i turn the engine off.  13th problem.  when locking the door from the outside touch button, it takes about 15 seconds to actually lock.   you will have to stand with the car to make sure it locks before you walk off and i end up hitting the button about 20 times before it actually locks the doors.   there is no delay if i use the remote, but then i have to dig it out of my pocket and that defeats the purpouse of a key fob  14th problem is with the dealer in Oklahoma City.  if i have a problem, there is a week delay to bring the car in to get it worked on.  if i want the free rental car they offer, there is a 2 week delay to bring the car in for servicing.  My local lexus dealer can get  me in the same day with a rental car  15th problem.   while hey claim everyting is included in the warranty including brakes and oilchanges, they dont include alignment, which had to be done twice",3,2014," BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"
"1087",2016-12-03,"Frenchy","2014 BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","BMW X3 A Jolly little toy for adults","Bought my X3 xdrive28i  3 years ago and drove it about 13 000/year. This car is a real pleasure to drive every morning to work. It takes away the boredom of the drive to work early every morning  I work about 25 miles away and my ride takes about 35 mn so I drive quite a lot. I used to dread that drive but this car made my mornings much more fun. I drive a mixed mileage on the highway and normal roads. The drive on the highway is a real breeze. I drive it on the comfort mode and the car has plenty enough of pick up to pass cars without any problems even at high speed. I am very surprised by the amount of power this little 4 cylinders has even when I go over 80 mile per hour. You can actually have a lot more pick up by switching it to the sport mode, which has great acceleration power, when you merge or want to change lanes fast.  This car is a lot of fun to drive. If you are lucky enough to live in a region with back roads, you can have a lot of fun to drive it. I live in PA and the car is great for hills and turns on tight roads. It grips the road. In one word, it drives fantastic. I took 2 trip to South Carolina with it and it drove fantastic. The interior is simple but looks great. I have the special lights on it and good God, they are amazing at night. The car also has an amazing break system that saved me a few times from hitting dear at night. The car all wheel drive is great on the snow. I used to have a Subaru Outback and I think this car is better on the snow. It comes with free maintenance for 4 years. I never paid anything until now except my inspection every year and a set of tires. Now for the negative. Not much to say the truth. The tires/wheels are the only thing I am having a problem with. In the winter, the pressure on the tires can vary quite a lot depending on the temperature. My dash board showed a few times a low pressure on the tires. I had to go to my gas station a few times in the winter to put air in my tires. I have Pirelli zero all weather run flat tires on this car and get ready to spend at least $350 to $400 per tire when you change them. They don't last long either (25 000 miles at most) but they are silent and grip the road. I guess this is the price to pay for performance tires and the security of run flat tires, but you can install normal tires that will cost a fraction of these if you prefer. The car does not have a spare wheel in case of a flat but BMW has free 24h road assistance included. Most insurances do too. My insurance went up by about $30/month when I switched from my Subaru Outback to this car too. The gas mileage is not great (21 miles at most per gallon on the highway) so I use the eco mode when I drive in the city (it does not save you much anyway). It shuts down the engine when the car stops which I like (you don't have to use this if you don't want to). The options are expensive and the price of the car can go up in a hurry. The head lights are well worth it though and I like the GPS on it once you know how to use it. The ondrive system is great (it links my I-phone 6 through bluetooth to my music and pandora automatically when you start the car without having to do anything but not to your e-mail. BMW does not allow texting and e-mailing while driving). The music system is not fantastic unless you get the upgrade (12 speakers) which is amazing and worth the money if you like to listen to music (loud and clear). That is the only regret on my car. I should have got this cause when I got into another model which had it, what a difference it was. Overall, this is a fantastic car. I have no regret about this car. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. This was the best present I ever bought myself for Christmas. Not cheap but if you have the means, you can't go wrong.My car is now out of warranty. 4.5 years old. Still nothing bad to say about it. No problems whatsoever for now. Still love this car which is pretty rare after such a period of time. No rust or other problems.

Ours was pretty well optioned and had the highest sticker price of the 3, but with USAA and BMW incentives, wound up the least expensive.The base engine has plenty of zip and is reasonably fuel efficient (not quite up to EPA estimates, but still not bad).It handles nicely on the road.If I did not drive a Mercedes E350 Sport, I'm sure I would be more effusive in my praise of the X3.After 2-1/2 years, my original review is still accurate.

Japan has it ALL OVER the imports from Europe in this regard...I rented a KIA that has more options and better visibility than this BMW...VERY unhappy.

"1100",2017-08-10,"Jonathon N.","2016 BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","MY SEVENTH BMW AND LEAST FAVORITE","I’m a 7-time BMW owner.  All 3-Series vehicles until now.  The X3.The X3 (I have a 2016 X3 AWD Gas) is my first South Carolina built BMW away from the 3-Series and the first non-German built BMW I have owned.  I learning to live with this non-luxury truck with its optional safety (by optional I mean sub-par headlights, no fender turn signals  and Goodyear run-flats).What a difference…  The anemic 4-cyclinder engine tries to move some 5,000 pounds around.  It struggles on hills (almost sounds diesel-like) but if you put the vehicle into what BMW calls the SPORTS MODE, performance will improve greatly because it cancels out (or re-directs) several short-throw gears on the transmission and the engine is married to the gearbox in a much faster pace (you will consume an extra 21% of fuel though).  The transmission is electronic.  I love it!  Responsive, fast, understanding of your needs and quick to the change by your demands.  Kudos to BMW for this system of near perfection and this same system really shows off its talent when used on the 3-series newer sedans or coupes (I’ve had loaners in the past).The parking brake is an electronic tab function.  Hold a TAB to place your X3 in the parking brake mode. BMW’s are usually like a train on rails.  Trains follow tracks.  You don’t drive or steer a train.  Trains are precise and follow a pattern.  Most BMW’s give you that same feeling of total control and responsibility.  The road is safely yours and if you get into a situation a BMW will get you out of it with plenty of power and precision steering.  Except for the X3 4-cylinder version.The X3 is a shoebox on wheels.  BMW has compromised safety where safety is now OPTIONAL instead of standard.  Be it cheap and yellowish basic headlights to turn signal indicators (side body panels) missing because you bought the wrong model.  Rim/Tire sizes being too small.  Backup camera or braking safety features all optional.  Simple safety no longer part of BMW standards.  Safety only available for sale.Expect cheap plastic seats called SENSA-TEC on entry level models (sometimes called Leatherette) that are miserable in comfort.  You’ll have to purchase the essential SPORT PACKAGE to get decent seats in leather and secured in comfort.  The rears are even worse making most park benches a luxury compared to the rear seats on a 2016 X3.Tires on the X3 are also downgraded to Goodyear’s (pending the model/version/year).  However, many cars on the dealers lot had Bridgestone’s (owned by Firestone) tires.  Pirelli’s should be on the X3 or a good second choice would be Michelin’s.  Once again, BMW downgrading the X3 to truck status.Ride quality is average.  We had to take off the ‘FRED FLINTSTONE’ Goodyear run flats and upgrade to the Michelin’s to get a better interstate ride.  It’s like turbulence over Florida sometimes with you sitting in the last row of the airplane. The X3 is stumpy, short and fairly boxy looking (whereas the X5 has a far classier look to it).  It bumps and it pulls and it fights the road when accomplishing interstate driving.Braking is average.  Not the soft and exact stopping that a BMW 3-series will give you but plan ahead and control your stop before you need to.  5000 lbs. is a lot a shoebox to stop.The Panoramic Sunroof is a must-have option and excellent in design.  It’s massive!  Back seat passengers especially benefit and it is a great distraction to the discomfort of those Spirit Airlines last row seats.  One of the better options available on the BMW X3.This is the most disappointing BMW I have owned to date.  Yet in fairness, my last BMW was a 335is convertible and now this is a totally, almost non-BMW truck experience.  We did a test drive of the RAV-4 before deciding on the X3 but when compared, the Toyota RAV 4 exceeded all handling and safety features when compared to the BMW X3 when factoring in price and reliability.  On the other hand, BMW paint and fit and finish was superior to Toyota’s cheaper paint and gel coating.   In just six (6) weeks, our rear hatch latch has broken off (it’s plastic instead of metal), we’ve changed out the bad tires, the driver’s side door won’t stay open, when opened (you have to walk it out into position) and of great concern is we had to accelerate this weekend to change lanes on an interstate and nothing happened.  Gas petal depressed fully.  No response.  Of major concern and to be looked at later this week.I’d never purchase another X3 BMW at any price.  Not a real German built BMW.  In fact, not the feeling of a BMW at all… If you decide on a X3, add the essential packages so that you’ll have the basic safety items now marketed only as options.  Going with the 35i X3 will provide for superior engine performance and adding a SPORTS PACKAGE above all will change the experience from rental car performance to some personal pride of ownership.",3,2016," BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

"1105",2016-07-31,"Ray A.","2016 BMW X3 SUV xDrive35i 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)","Not for everyone","There are a lot a good features about the BMW X3, but overall if I had the decision to make all over again I would choose something else.  First the good things.  1) The power from the 3.0L turbo is very good.  It is refined and the transmission shifts smoothly.  2) The active stop and go cruise control is worth the extra cost.  When you are sitting stop and go traffic it is a wonderful feature.  3) Back seats and cargo capacity are very good for this class of SUV.  4) I-Drive is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  5) Heads up display is a great feature.  I have it on another car and think more vehicles should have this as an option.Now for the things that I am disappointed with after having this BMW for a few months.  1)  The upgraded Harmon Kardon system sounds just OK.  I had a Harmon system in a Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and it rocked in comparison to this system.  At louder volume levels the sound is a bit harsh.  2) The keyless entry system can be a bit flakey.   With the key in my pocket I have issues opening and locking the door.  I have to take the key out of my pocket to make it work.  I don't have this issue on my GM with a keyless system.   Plus for a vehicle of this price point, I think its kind of cheap to not have them on the rear doors too.  3) Both rear tail lights have flaws from the molding process.  I have looked at others and you can barely see the injection points in the lens, but mine stand out like sore thumb.  They look like white dots on the tail lights.  The dealer says they are in spec.  Again for the price of these SUV's is seams these could be made better.  4) Went I got it I thought the interior was nice and was fitting of the luxury brand.  But over time, some the materials feel cheep.  Even with upgraded leather, the ruff texture makes it feel like fake leather.  It was not until I got in my friends new Cadillac XT5 did I really notice the difference.   The Cadillac is light years ahead on interior quality.  I can feel the ruff seam on the top and bottom of the turn signal stalk where the two pieces of plastic meet.5) No vented front seats and power tilt/telescoping wheel.  A miss on this class and price point.6) Auto Start/Stop is poorly programmed.  Many times it stops the moment you stop.  There should be a couple of seconds delay.  When coming to a stop sign or switching gears while pulling into a parking space, I have had the engine shut off just to restart again while it was shutting off.  Then there are times when you think it should shut off and it does not.   I have stopped and put it into park and it won't shut off.  The only plus is you can disable the feature.  I highly recommend this if you have the A/C on.7) Front parking sensors are slow to engage.  Don't pull up to something quickly and expect them to be active.8) Having to hit the Start/Stop button twice to shut everything off is annoying.  Once to stop the engine the second time to turn off accessories.  If you don't the accessories stay on even after you open the door.  It will timeout once you have locked the door, but I don't trust it.  You should only have to hit it once to turn the engine off.  Then when you open the drivers door it shuts off the accessories. 9) It was not until I a took a long trip and my left leg started falling asleep how bad the comfort is on the bottom of the front seats.  They are not good.  The cushion is too short on the front and sides. 10) Just got the recall notice about the rear child safety seat anchor.  Give this vehicle is been on the market for a while I am surprised that this has come up this late in the product cycle.  What concerns me how they have to fix this.  They need to remove the rear seats and carpet, send it out a body shop to have a support bracket welded in.  Not liking the sound of welding something in a brand new vehicle.***UPDATE***I traded the BMW in after 6 months.   When you spend this kinda money on a car and are not happy with it you need to go with something else.   The something else is a 2014 Cadillac CTS Vsport with under 25K miles.   This is an amazing car.   Can't wait to get into it each day and drive.   This is what a luxury car should be.",3,2016," BMW X3 SUV xDrive35i 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

Got basic xDrive28, just added leather, camera and 19"" wheels.Unfortunately the car is missing some basic options in base trim as for that price. I understand that you can get all that as packages,  but then price will jump too high:1) LED/HID headlamps 2) Intelligent key less entry (when you just touch the door handler).3) No lambda on front seats. Even headrest is only up-down now (used to be 4-way adjustable, it's still 4-way adjustable in 3-series in base trim) . I'm lucky the seat is comfortable for me, but you don't know until drove a long distance. Test drive won't show that.4) Blind-spot detectors.Other considerations:1) You will not like electric steering at least for a few weeks if you used to old-school BMW with power steering (I guess prior to 2012). After all it's not bad but definitely gives less steering feeling. 2) I still don't like sound of turbo-4. However it drives good, with adequate acceleration and fast shifting. And it doesn't loose power on high-way speeds.Complaints - I had certain lease issues with the dealership. Unfortunate BMW customers service didn't help me.

"1109",2016-04-18,"NCUltraRunner","2016 BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","So far so great!","I was considering the Audi Q5, Lexus NX200t and Range Rover Evoque before deciding on the BMW X3. I was almost seduced by the Evoque, but reading all of the owner horror stories scared me away. I took delivery of my X3 in December 2015 and have already put about 7500 miles on the vehicle. Thus far, the X3 has performed flawlessly and has not disappointed! Initial build quality appears to be worthy of the price tag.I've found the xDrive system to work very well on the road during inclement weather (heavy rain, light snow), although I did not have to put it to the test in deep snow. I do not have the Dynamic Handling Package, but given how well the X3 handles the road without it, I'm not really sure how much of a difference I might notice with it. I've read other reviews where some felt the ride was too harsh, but I don't share that opinion, although I do like to feel the road perhaps more than some might. The vehicle handles and accelerates so smoothly perhaps with the exception of the auto start/stop feature which can be noticeable at times. I leave it in the ""Comfort"" drive mode most of the time. I put it in ""Sport"" mode, when merging onto a freeway or needing to get through busy intersections when I need the extra burst of acceleration. I rarely use ECO Mode. I've found the gas mileage between ECO and Comfort to be relatively negligible and the gearing is just too dulled down for my liking in ECO mode. I've been averaging just over 23 miles per gallon for which probably 75% of my miles are highway.I find the interior of the X3 to be nicely appointed and up to standards of fit and finish for the class of vehicle. I find the seating to be comfortable and the climate control system to work very well. The Infotainment system menu is fairly intuitive and with a little playing around with it, you should be able to figure out most of the functions and settings in relatively short order. The iDrive controller is easy to use to navigate the control panel, but some of the buttons on the passenger side of the controller are hard to see from the driver's seat. The one function I haven't really used much is the voice command system, so I can't really comment to how accurately it works. The buttons and controls on the dashboard and steering wheel all seem to be well placed with proper tactile feel.In my opinion, there are a few ""must"" have packages to avoid buyer's remorse:* xLine or M Sport Package: I think either of those significantly enhance the aesthetics of the vehicle. I went with the xLine. I'm happy with it, but wish the Sport Seats that you get with the M Sport package was an available option.* Lighting Package: Recommend going with either the Xenon or Full LED. Either the Xenon or LED seem to throw a much brighter light and I personally think they look much better than the yellowish Halogens. I opted for the Xenon lights and am very happy with them.* Dual-Pane Moonroof (either as standalone option or part of the Premium Package). About as close to the convertible feel as you can get.As far as the other options go, I opted the following: Premium package, Technology package, Driver Assistance package, Driver Assistance Plus, Harman Kardon Sound System and Heated Front Seats. Unfortunately, in order to get certain features, you have to opt for entire packages. For example, if you want Lumbar Support on the front seat, you have to get the Premium package. If you want the Head Up display, you have to get the Technology package. The safety features are spread out between the Driver Assistance Package and Driver Assistance Plus. If you only want rear view camera and parking sensors, you can just opt for the Driver Assistance package. However, of all the available safety features, Active Blind Spot detection was most important to me so I had to select the Driver Assistance Plus package which also requires you to select the Driver Assistance package. I've found the surround view camera feature that is part of the Driver Assistance Plus package to be very useful as well. I'm hardly an audiophile, but the HK sound system sounds good to my ears. The Heated Front seats have 3 settings and heat up quickly.There are a few features missing that I would have liked to see available on the X3:* Full size spare or at least a temporary spare. This is my biggest gripe. My X3 came with run flats. There is no hole in the cargo area for any type of spare nor under the vehicle. I've seen aftermarket temporary spares available, but unless you put it on your roof rack, you have to put it in the rear cargo area which then leaves you with little cargo room.* Cooled front seats. I have black Nevada leather and would really have liked the option to have cooled front seats for the hot weather.* Auto-Folding Side Mirrors. The side mirrors do fold with the press of a button on the driver's side door, but why not fold automatically when the vehicle is turned off?",5,2016," BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

However, I wanted to write this review for people interested in diesel cars as I was, and there weren’t too many comments in regards to diesel engines. I was in search of a diesel car that will have a high MPG and be a little bit bigger than a sedan. I didn’t care about brands in the beginning knowing that I will sort it out at the end based on price/mpg/quality, etc.After narrowing down I ended up with 2 models: BMW X3 diesel and MB GLK250 diesel.

PURCHASE it for my wife.2 months later I found an X3 diesel in Texas @ 36K brand new, but with rear window busted by the hails. The dealer replaced the window for free, but I paid for fixing the wiring as the rain water affected the rear side. 1 year later, both cars have about 10k miles put on them, and I can say that MB is the best as performance. Acceleration: BMW is on 8 speed transmission and the car is slow until you reach about 30MPH. The ratio on speed changes is small and that will keep you slow. It is irritant to see all kind of other brands vehicles to be faster than your BMW car, from stop to 30-35 MPH. GLK250 instead is on 7 speed transmission but the ratio is distributed different and you have the starting speed what you’ll need. Comfort: BMW is better as the seats are a bit better built and placed. The infotainment system has more options (like a computer) while MB is pretty simple (for old guys like me).  MPG: I drove the BMW from Oregon to NY with constant speeds above 80 / 85 MPH and the MPG was about 30MPG. The driving comfort was ok as I drove about 12 hours / day. It bothered when I had to go to speeds lower than 30MPH as the transmission changed gears and it seems to not catch up speed at least as fast as other cars.  In the “city”: I did UBER/LYFT for about 6 months and I achieved about 28 MPG in a stop and go traffic about 8-12 hours/day (on the days I worked). During the winter (snow and ice) it performed excellent. No slips, plenty of torque on snowy hills. Now on the NY routes I am getting about 35MPG even more if there were no hills. The best was 45MPG on a 75 miles trip at 45-55MPH. The GLK250: most highway trips were between Portland and Seattle and the MPG was about 33MPG @ an average of 75MPH. In the city (stop and go) I am constantly getting about 30 MPG. But leaving from stop lights is a pleasure. NOISE: Definitely both cars are quitter than their predecessors and while running you won’t make the difference between the gas and diesel engines. However, GLK is at least 50% quitter than X3. Now if I would have to start shopping again, I will definitely not buy an X3 anymore, but 2 GLK’s. Unfortunately, MB is not making diesel mid-size SUV’s / cross-overs or at least this is what I know at this point. Breaks: I drove Toyota and Honda for many years, but BMW’s breaks are worst. You have to push hard on them is not like the other cars where you gentle push the breaks and stops without efforts. If you’ll check the forums you’ll see that breaks and rotors are a common problem for BMW’s. If you open up the CARFAX reports on autotrader, you’ll see that almost every 30k the pads/rotors were replaced. GLK has pretty much the same habit, but maybe at 45K…Hopefully this will help you take the right decision.

As diesels remain largely unpopular in the US, I got a fabulous deal on this car.  It was a service vehicle for the dealership with 3K miles when purchased, and I got 19% off the MSRP.

We are not very often at the Gas Station and get an average 680 miles from empty to full.  2/. Servicing is only every 10,000 miles or 1 year and our Local BMW Dealership is only 10 miles from home. Very convenient.  3/. Insurance is reasonable and with all the safety aspects we get 36% discount.  4/. Road Side Assistance is all in for 10 years. Part of the deal.  BMW give you 4 years Free Maintenance  but we offered to pay for an extra 2 years having taken the finance over 6 years. Thus when we have to pay for 7th Maintenance our car will be paid off. The car is a delight to drive and the twin turbo kicks in well when needed. Snow and ice are no problem.  X3diesel is always going to hold a good resell factor as a good one is very hard to find.

After adjusting the seats I find them very comfortable (Nevada leather).  The interior design is classy, although some of the buttons are difficult to see from the driver's seat.  The engine is not as quiet as my Q5 TDI, but you don't hear it cruising down the highway.  The car came with 18 inch wheels with Pirelli P7s and they are quiet so far.  The idrive infotainment system is complex, but most functions work by voice command and it works well.  The build quality is excellent and there are no rattles, even from the panoramic sunroof.  The suspension is firm, well composed and comfortable.  The auto Stop/Start works well and definitely saves fuel at those long traffic lights.

This one is better.  The transmission on the 2009 is smoother than the 2007, this one has the upgraded stereo and it sounds better, but also just the tuner knob is nicer and easier to use.  It could be just my perception, but it seems more stable in corners at speed.  Gas mileage is great on both - I get 21 or 22 mixed, and 26 to 28 highway in the Rocky mountains between 50 and 80 miles an hour.  MPG is one of the best features, and it comes from a powerful engine that is ready to pass anything, anytime even going up a mountain.  Front seats are fully adjustable and very comfortable.  Drive noise is quite minimal, making it hard to drive anything less insulated.  The over all size is small, which I like for fitting through traffic and parking, and I find the cargo space to be large for the size of the car.  Traction control with Michelin X-Ice tires is excellent on snow, frozen hard surface snow, and good on clear ice.  Braking is crisp and tight, as is the steering.  The ride is firm, but I found I like it better than Mercedes ML350 and ML 550 that I test drove.  Driving it really does feel like a sporty car - much better visibility than a Porsche Cayenne, and the Porsche and Mercedes 550 felt too tight in the cockpit for me.  I'm 6'3"", and my only real complaint is that the transmission box is wide in the X3 and pushes my right foot in at an odd angle that makes my knee and hip feel tweaked.  It bugs me, but when my 2007 got totaled by a friend, and I had to replace it, after looking at the Mercedes and a Mazda CX-7, this one is just soooo fun to drive (and the gear shift is useful and fun) and gets such good mileage, that I couldn't get as excited about anything else.  **If you get one, you must rotate tires regularly.  Irregular wear on tires will confuse the traction control and transmission and make you think it's a junk car, but it's your tires and/or suspension**",5,2009," BMW X3 SUV xDrive30i 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6M)"

The X3 is a beautiful vehicle with a gorgeous interior.  I especially like the dashboard design, the instrumentation and the interior lighting.  I had been shopping for months for an X3 with the upgraded Harmon Kardon sound system because the base sound system is lousy, especially for a premium vehicle such as the X3.  I found one, a nice '17 model with only 11K miles (the salesman couldn't tell me where the car came from, whether it was traded in or an off-lease, which I found surprising).  I took it for a test drive, then I negotiated a decent price.  During the test drive, I noticed the ride was firm, but it didn't seem overly so.  The X3 comes with either Goodyear or Pirelli tires, and the ones with the Goodyear tires seem to ride a bit smoother, although both brands are run-flat tires since the X3 doesn't come with a spare.  During the time I was signing papers, I was surprised to find out that the warranty is very limited and in fact, they give you a four-page document listing everything that is NOT covered.  That was kind of an eye-opener.  Once I signed all the papers, I spent about 40 minutes with a young man who reviewed all the options and features with me.  It was a bit overwhelming, but I figured with time it would all make sense.  Once I left the lot, the trouble started.  The first thing I noticed was that I felt every crack and bump in the road.  The ride was jarring and uncomfortable.  Then, once I hit about 70MPH on the highway, I heard a whistling sound coming from the area of the sunroof.  Uh-oh.  ""Is this why it was traded in so soon"", I wondered.  Then, I tried to listen to a song from my iPhone, but it wouldn't play,  I fiddled with every logical option to get it to play, but no luck.  I was miserable, thinking I had made a big mistake trading in my trusty '13 RAV4 for this rough-rider.  Once I got home, I sat in the driveway and wondered what to do.  Would I get used to it or was a making a compromise that would prove difficult to live with?  I decided the latter and promptly returned to the dealership.  Luckily, they had not registered it in my name yet, so after some probing questions from the salesman and the manager, they refunded my deposit, tore up the paperwork and gave me back my RAV4.  I felt relieved and feel that I made the right decision.  My advice is to take the car, any car, for a long test drive before making the decision to buy.

I got a very good deal and the dealer was entirely professional. This X3 xdrive is an enormous disappointment though and honestly borders on feeling unsafe to drive. Why? The steering is so bizarre it's hard to keep the car in your lane without having it wander unexpectedly. After it does you correct but small corrections do nothing and larger ones over compensate so you need to correct again. This is constant and driving takes a ton of concentration as you're always fixing the direction of the car. Ever have a bicycle where the steering stem was loose and when you turned the handle nothing happened? That's what driving this car feels like. There's also no digital speedometer and a hard to read analog one so you never really know how fast you're going. Oh you can pull up the trip mileage MPH so you know how fast you went last year but you can't know how fast you're currently driving. I guess that's not important. Then there's the low on gas warning light which is a small triangle (about 1/8"") that's so dim you'll never see it in the daylight. The fonts on the dash are small and hard to read, the heater seems to only heat at the highest setting and anything below it blows cold air. Mine has rattles and squeaks.

Maintenance is 3 years or 36,000 miles. The driving safety features like blind spot assist work at any speed, not just over 35 mph. Saab vs. BMW, you got to be kidding me, but I'm not surprised given the extreme loyalty Saab drivers have with their cars. But you cannot compare the two in pretty much every way. BMW's iDrive is way more advanced than any radio/information center ever put into a Saab. Maybe that's the problem, the BMW is too advanced for you. It sounds like some of the issues with the negative reviews were as a result of a poor delivery experience. The issues discussed could have been easily remedied if you had a delivery that showed you how to use the iDrive system. There are so many easy ways to customize the iDrive system and the options to do so are rather endless. If you're not sure how to find something, just ask the voice commands as you can literally ask it to do anything. And the best part with the iDrive system is there no lag with waiting for info to load, like the Mercedes command center. I suggest talking to your BMW service center and arranging for another experience. Oh, and there is no BMW Complaint option in the iDrive. The X3 performs better than the suggested EPA, and I usually 7-10 over the speed limit. The seats are super comfortable, offering good support. And for someone who is interested in keeping as good of posture possible, these seats will do the trick because they are firm and offer many adjustments. The x3 28i will not blow  you away with its power but it is more the sufficient when power is needed, especially for every day driving. Plus, I'm not buying a SAV to drive crazy and super fast, so this engine is perfect. Awesome ways to adjust the 2nd row to put all 3 seats down or any one of the 3 down for added cargo storage.

With three clicks, you can turn it off, but it won’t stay off.  Every time you start the vehicle, it will come back to annoy you – first with a legal disclaimer and then an array of meaningless menu choices.  It’s impossible to make the screen display something useful like a digital clock (a Kia will do that, but a BMW won’t).  I’d settle for a BMW logo on the screen, but even that’s not an option.The menu is loaded with choices leading quickly to lots of useless information, but changing the audio source for the stereo is 3-4 clicks and a couple of knob-spins away.  You’ll find the FM/HD radio choice is in a different section of the menu than the CD player and Bluetooth devices.  Perhaps it’s just German humor.Info that’s more easily accessed includes the owner’s manual (should you be reading that on the dashboard while driving?) and contact info for the BMW complaint center (maybe BMW owners use that one a lot?).  You can also schedule a service appointment with a random BMW dealership with just a couple of clicks.  But they can’t fix your menu.Want to “search by picture” and learn more about “screw thread for tow fitting” on this car’s front bumper?  That’s literally choice #3 of 12 on an image of the vehicle, just two clicks and a quarter-spin away.  But once again – is this info you should be using while the vehicle’s moving?  However if you need to call your spouse, plan on pulling over to the side of the road and scrolling through the alphabet, because the “favorites” from your iPhone will not upload to this system and the voice-dial feature is erratic at best.I like a lot of things about my 2017 BMW – great steering and acceleration, quiet and steady ride, nice lines, quality trim everywhere.

My 2015 Sorento SX was loaded and I do miss my remote start already which was not an option on the BMW for all the things you can get. But I will say that everything just feels and sounds better in the BMW. Is it $10,000 better I can't say yet but for me if I am going to pay $550 to $750 to own not lease a car it is worth it imo to love what you are driving. I did love my Optima SX with the 2.0 turbo and it was only $400 per month with 0% interest but sometimes you just need to fit something more than you can in just a rear seat pass thru. I really didn't do much research before I bought it on Black Friday and  got $2500 off msrp and $1000 BMW rebate/cash/credit whatever you want to call it. So for the last 3 weeks I have been watching reviews and reading up and I can say I don't have any buyers remorse. The only thing I am used to is 0% with Kia and my Nissan but I guess 2.9% for 72 is the best BMW usually offers. I wanted the M Sport and a few other options. There were a lot of vehicles to chose from but only a few with the M sport package. I actually went in looking at the X1 because it really isn't that much smaller and the price was less. The 2018 X3 will be all new and probably larger to make it more different from the recently upgraded X1. I am happy to buy at the end of the current models cycle because hopefully all the bugs are worked out. The only X1 they had with the M sport was loaded with 2 packages I didn't want and was the great BMW astral blue but not my first choice. Nearby was the X3 I ended up with for only $4000 more and still over loaded but it had the 20"" M sport staggered wheel package that just makes it look so much better. I checked the price of replacement tires because I don't want to pay $300 or more for a tire but found  great options that are not run flats but will get a spare and take care of that down the road. I drive my cars close to the limit and I ride sport bikes and of course I have not driven the X3 even close to max because it is not even close to being broken in but what I have noticed is that when you push it just a little it seems fine and enjoyable but the next level it I think it will be not quite as enjoyable. Should I have gotten the 3.5i with the adjustable suspension maybe but at close to $56,000 there are a lot of other performance options out there. I think my biggest complaint will be with the 8 speed Auto trans instead of some of the dual clutch auto's available. Manual is not an option for me because of other drivers in my family not to mention I prefer to concentrate more on my lines and braking etc. than shifting. In sport it seems to hold the gear to long and doesn't seem to read your mind and once it does shift its brisk but jerky. Maybe it will get better when it learns my habits but I think it will be in comfort or sport plus where you have to shift up or down yourself when I am alone. I think if the car is problem free I will keep it and add the Dinan computer upgrade dealer installed and doesn't void the warranty that adds over 40hp and 40 ft/lbs of torque at the wheels and get coil over suspension that I can slightly lower the X3 and have adjustable rebound dampening to make an even firmer but not to stiff of a ride. Another thing I like is I see a lot of X3's x1's and X5's but not to many with the M package or the nice rims. Mostly x5's so it looks different from most out there without customizing.",5,2017," BMW X3 SUV xDrive28i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

It seemed a given for a vehicle of that grade.  The interface with my phone is limited and delayed.

I asked why the news was being displayed on the screen then.  He said reading the news was not as distracting as hearing a text read out.  Oh well.  I will be having Apple CarPlay installed for $300.  Without it, the display screen is less useful because you must constantly reach for your phone to switch between music and entertainment apps.

Other cars I considered were mid-sized SUVs from Volvo, Mercedes, and Audi, all of which cost roughly the same when configured with the same packages and options.  I also considered the slightly larger Lexus RX.  I had to order the car as there were none available that had all the packages and options I wanted, but the car arrived just four weeks after I placed the order.  I'm very pleased so far.  This is my first BMW, my previous recent vehicles being Lexus and Mercedes.  I was pleased that I was able to get the car equipped with regular, rather than run-flat tires.  I have averaged a bit over 27 mpg in 1,000 miles of mixed driving.  I am particularly pleased with the intuitive controls and very good voice recognition.  Both are far better than in previous vehicles I have owned.  This is the first car I have had with a heads up display, which I have found particularly useful when using navigation since directions are shown in the display as needed.  The front seats are quite comfortable and adaptable.  Most car functions can be tailored through the infotainment system screen by accessing menus and submenus, and these can be accessed directly through the touch screen or by using a central controller.  Some functions, like answering a call or changing audio volume can be accessed in as many as five ways (button on the steering wheel, voice command, touch screen, central controller, hand gesture control).  The adaptive cruise control is also a very nice feature and works well.  The shifter and parking brake take a little getting used to.  The car has three driving modes, comfort, sport, and economy.  The instrument display changes for each of these and the sport and economy modes can be customized.  All modes work well but I mostly just drive in comfort mode, which is the default when the car is started.  This vehicle may be a little too small and have too little cargo room if you have kids to transport.  The car listed for about $56,600 and I got about $3,000 dollar discount.  Not a great deal but good enough given that I got exactly what I wanted.  All in all, I'm very happy with the vehicle so far.",5,2018," BMW X3 SUV xDrive30i 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

It’s pretty heavily optioned which means the sticker was high, but it has met all my expectations.  I moved up from a 2010 335i.  I loved that car, and in many ways I miss it.  It was a stick shift and drove like a sports car, brittle ride and all.  The X3 is a fast family car, and feels every bit it’s size compared to my 335.  Especially in tight spaces. People who have driven SUVs may not feel the same, but this is a first for me.  Which is not to say that freeway onramps aren’t a hoot in the X3, because they are.  In fact, in my highly scientific comparison, I am pretty sure my new X3 can take a corner at a faster clip than my old 335.  Credit the bigger tires?  Anyway... two features I want to address that have been lamented in the press.  The first is the “too heavy steering” in sport mode.  Huh?  Honestly I don’t get this, as I can BARELY discern the different in weight from comfort mode.  The transition itself from comfort to sport feels a little artificial while underway, but once set it feels great.  I don’t get the too heavy comments.  Second and perhaps most importantly, gesture control.  People say this is a gimmick.  Seems like a bunch of lemming journalists to me all jumping on the same bandwagon. Granted I have yet to use some of the call features, but the volume and “next channel / track” (i.e., custom gesture) features i use ALL THE TIME.

In almost 1,800 miles my fuel economy overall is 80 miles per gallon!  My commute is about 15 miles round trip and the car does it in fully electric MAXEDrive mode with the piston engine never coming on. I have 800 miles on the current tank and I've barely used half of the ten gallon tank. What has amazed me most is that I've driven about 65 percent highway miles and have still achieved this economy. It takes less than 2 hours to recharge on my level 2 charger and the electric range is about 15 miles on pure electric. The car replaced a BMW ActiveHybrid 3 and the 330e is far and away better in ride, handling and economy. For 2016 the sport package is standard which gives you sport seats as well as sport+ mode which firms up the steering and tightens up the shifting and throttle response. The transition from electric to piston engine is pretty seamless with a clunk occasionally occurring on the transition but most of the time almost unnoticeable. Last weekend I travelled 150 miles on the freeway and some twisty back roads and the overall fuel economy started at 84 mpg with it going down to 78 mpg by the end of the trip. I'm back up to almost 80 again today after a fully electric commute. Acceleration on electric is perfectly fine for urban driving and when you want performance it is as torquey as the 6 cylinder ActiveHybrid and faster than a 328i. With the $4000 tax credit it is priced the same as a 328i as well.  I am still experimenting with the 3 electric drive modes. MAXEDrive is fully electric for up to 15 miles. AUTOeDrive is a mixed hybrid and electric mode that switches from battery electric to gasoline or a combination depending on throttle input, speed and grade. SAVE mode is a hybrid mode that recharges a depleted battery and allows you to switch to fully electric mode at the end of a trip or to save battery for urban driving. The sport seats that are now standard are much better than the standard seats as well with better bolstering and an adjustable thigh support. Not everyone will get the economy I am getting as my commute is the ideal distance for the car's range and I plug in religiously, but the car is really exceeding even my high expectations.

With a shocking 445 horsepower and a 4.4L V8 engine, this BMW is built for speed. In the previous models the 5 series had the available option for an auto-stop start system, which saves gas while the vehicle is at a complete stop. Standard features on the new 5 series along with the older models starting at 2011 include power trunk lid, satellite radio, navigation, and Harman Kardon sound system.  The 5 series comes with a variety of engines such as the 528i, 535i, 535d, and 550i. Some may have ""xdrive"" applied with their names, indicating it is all-wheel drive.The BMW is a four-door five passenger sedan. It is compatible with the Jaguar XF, Mercedes Benz E-class, Audi A6, Lexus GS 350, Cadillac CTS, and the Maserati Ghibli. Surprisingly, the 550i series remains the better choice over all of those vehicles. For it to be such a large sedan it goes from zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds. If you are looking for a sporty but luxury four-door sedan, the BMW 5 series is definitely a great way to go. It comes in tons of color options inside and out, along with technology package as well. For example, if you are looking for an vehicle for luxury and sport but not too big on the luxury side, the 5 series is perfect. The 5 series can switch from comfort also known as luxury to sport by the push of one button. You will not go wrong if you choose this vehicle. Pros of the 550i includes, Superb engines with impressive fuel economy in most forms; high-quality interior that's packed with high-tech features; comfortable and composed ride. Cons includes, Ho-hum handling; relatively small trunk; intrusive auto stop-start system. Some safety features range from stability and traction control, anti-lock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. The braking system also periodically wipes the brake rotors dry in wet conditions and automatically snugs the brake pads to the rotors in preparation when you abruptly lift off the throttle. Another standard feature is the BMW Assist and Remote Services emergency communications systems, which include automatic crash notification, an SOS button, remote door unlock and stolen vehicle recovery.Parking sensors and a rear-view camera are standard on the 550i and optional on other models. An upgraded side- and top-view parking camera system is optional. The Driver Assistance Plus package includes a blind-spot warning system, a lane-departure warning system and a forward-collision warning system with automatic braking.

My other two cars are a 2014 Prius Sedan and a 2014 Prius V. I have owned GM's, Fords, Cadillac's, Jeeps, but for some reason I like diesel engines better. The first BMW,  I absolutely fell in love with that car. I got 40mpg in town and 45 to 46 mpg on the highway. The car was so good, I wanted bigger, and decided to buy the 2016 BMW 535 diesel with the 6 cylinder engine. BMW did not skimp on quality or luxury with this car. I have never had any maintenance problem with BMW's, I keep my cars properly serviced and inspection clean. I get better mileage then what BMW says on their sticker, because, just like a Prius, you have to learn HOW to properly drive one.  Some pro drivers don't like the cut off feature when the vehicle is stopped, and restart, but it never bothered me. It's a fuel saver. BMW diesel engines make very little noise. They are a pleasure to drive, and the car remains tight and noise free. The technical features are numerous but only add to the enjoyment of the vehicle. Just take a test drive in either the gas or diesel and you will see what I'm talking about.  Note: I wrote this review last year at age 72. My opinion remains the same. Only the millage has changed.UPDATE April 29, 2017:  My review of this car remains unchanged. In fact, I usually trade cars about every three years, but am considering just keeping this one. I keep the car garaged, had opti guard put on it when new, use a leather conditioner that is used on Rolls Royce cars, and keep the car in show room condition. The ride is still great and long drives are relaxing, comfortable and the six cylinder is plenty of power. Plus as I keep saying, a diesel engine will perform under the worst conditions and abuse. My dealership has an outstanding service department that checks on me now and then to see if everything ok or if I need any service.

I took it on the freeway and when I got to 70mph I noticed vibration coming out from the front wheels. I am not sure if it is simply a balance issues or something more serious but the fact of the matter is that it should of been tested before me and fixed. This is SUPER unacceptable considering they want 60k for the car to have vibration coming out of the front wheels that I surely noticed.  Overall everything else seems to be ok. I really liked Sound System and how soft it accelerated and drove. It was pretty quiet when compared to other cars in the same class. I also did not like that if you want to get some nice options like Premium seats with Ventilation you have to get a Package, same with LED Lights and Sport wheels with suspension. By the time I add everything I want on the car it cost about 80k, which is high considering it is only a 5 series car and NOT even 6 or 7 series.

While I gave up better mileage on the 4 cylinder, I got more room, window display, and a few more options that make driving a pleasure. I have owned other high quality cars, but the interior trim of the BMW with the rich wood and colors seem to stand out more. It may not hug the road like the 328, but neither did my other larger cars. Diesel engines rock, and if the public is scared off by the VW publicity, shame on them. In the long run, the quality of BMW engines and technology will keep the value of these cars up. I have liked this 2016 BMW 535 so much, I have decided to keep it beyond the two year period I usually trade cars. You can't hear the diesel engine, the cut off does not bother me (there is a switch to cut this feature off if it bothers others) and having driven many other gas and diesel engines, I know how to get above the EPA rated mileage. You get savings both ways with diesel prices going down or if fuel prices go up.....you will have more driving range then a gasoline engine. In the worst case, if we ever had a gas shortage, you can bet diesel fuel will be around. In short, my write up is no substitute for you taking a test drive in this auto and see for yourself.

I had Opti Coat put on it after I bought it and I keep it garaged and personally detail the vehicle to 'show room condition'. My wife and I use it primarily for long trips because it is so comfortable and roomy. If you check reviews today of the vehicle, you will see it is rated as one of the best. Because one car company cheated on diesel engines, it scared the public about diesels for awhile. I also have a 2017 BMW M24i, and a 2016 Prius V. But for comfort and style, you can't beat this car.

I had problems with the fuel pump (thank God while still under warranty).  I took it into D-Patrick in Evansville, IN where I purchased the car.  The service department agreed that the fuel pump was weak and had been a common problem with this vehicle.  However, they said it wasn't ""far enough gone"" to warrant replacement by BMW.  I took it in 2 or 3 times, being told the same thing each time.  The fuel pump went out on me during rush hour traffic as I had just got on the approach to a bridge (in the left lane).  The car lost ALL POWER!  By the grace of GOD, I had barely enough speed to crest the hill on the bridge and coast down the other side & managed to get through traffic to pull to the right shoulder of roadway & wait for tow truck.  When I notified D-Patrick's BMW service department, I was told that BMW designed the vehicle to shut down ""to preserve the engine"".  However, service department NEVER mentioned this would happen either time I had brought it in for this problem.  My question to them was ""What about preserving my life and the lives of whomever could have been with me when the fuel pump went out?  One would think, this would have been important information to share with me one of the times I took it in for problems with the fuel pump.  They did replace it.

Prior review - Purchased the vehicle as CPO 5 years ago. The car has performed satisfactorily well over time. 528i sport offers a great balance between performance and maintenance cost. On the sport package, you can rotate tires for longer life. Having the CPO warranty and maintenance to 100K was instrumental in managing ownership costs. Also, pays off in the long run because this ensures maintenance is performed by BMW using genuine parts. I feel this has contributed to reliability I enjoy at 130K mile. The cheapest way to maintain a BMW is with the dealer. BMW service is great and the reps generally do their best to help you out. Although, service must be scheduled well in advance to get a BMW loaner.  Reliability, relative to 15 years ago, has improved on these vehicles.

Bought my gorgeous 535i (with the sport package and premium sound) as a special order, and it arrived with 3 miles on the odometer. Since I bought it, I have been plagued with problems. Admittedly, the first 4+ years were pretty much covered under free maintenance with the warranty, but since it went off the maintenance agreement, it has more than made up for the savings. My car is 8 years old and has 107K miles. During the time I've owned it, it has required: - Three complete sets of tires plus two sets of rear tires (roughly every 20-30K miles)- A valve replaced in the engine (towed)- All six fuel injectors (limped in to the shop)- Walnut blasting of the intakes- A water pump (towed)- Computer software reinstalled (twice, took more than a week each time at the dealership for the reinstall to ""stick"") (towed)- Three fuel pumps (towed)- And now, the CCC is bad. This is a fancy acronym for the iDrive computer system that includes navigation, radio, bluetooth and all the car's controls. It also needs the hydraulics in the hood replaced, the xenon headlight has a malfunction (which requires the entire headlight assembly to be removed from the body of the car to change a LIGHTBULB, and if god forbid the ballast is bad, the bumper must be removed as well). For a change, it is actually driving fairly well, but this repair is gonna cost more than all the others yet!

It also does not hold car seats very well - infant carriers have to go in the middle back seat or the passenger seat will have to be on the dash, and convertible front-facing seats don't leave a ton of room either. It drives beautifully. Handles like a dream. Is so comfortable. Feels like a beast when you want it to. Rides gracefully. Looks pretty. Has an amazing sound system.

The BMW has warning signals for many different things, including that the outside temperature is now 37°.  However, it does not have a warning signal to say that for whatever reason a seal in the transmission has blown and all of the fluid is leaking out.  Leading to the need for a new transmission.  I have had innumerable problems with the engine, electronics, lights, you name it.  I also have had to replace one of the turbos at only 80,000 miles and of course replaced the other one at the same time. $3,200 later it is running fine. But there is still that $1,400 oil pan that will need to be fixed soon enough. Which I decided just to fix rather than continually worry it would implode on me 100 miles from a reliable repair shop.  I bought the car in 2011 with only 25,000 miles on it.  If I have not spent $20,000 in repairs since then, I would be surprised.  Don't waste your money.On the positive side, when it is working and especially on the highway it is a lot of fun to drive.  It gets mediocre mileage around  town (it is quite heavy).

That being said, it is not the most fun to own.  I have had numerous mechanical issues and even more electronic issues.  I have heard a few complain about the battery. I have switched to an Optima battery, which is cheaper and lasts longer.  I have heard that BMW knew about his battery draining issue before they release it, but decided to replace the batteries instead of fixing the issue.  The VANOS system had a glitch out east, oiling system out west, sparkplug in the Midwest, and a constant brake issue.  I am afraid to open the sunroof for fear that it will not close properly and I’ll have to take it apart and manually close it.  The parking assist doesn’t work at all and when it had worked it was over sensitive.  Our front windshield was replaced and I still can’t get the intermittent wipers to work properly.  The transmission seems to be slipping and I am not willing to spend the money to replace it.  If it was repaired at a BMW dealer, it would total the car.  Found out the differential bearing is bad and the unit has to be replaced not the bearing (a $5,000 job). Nothing is cheap to replace on the car and local shop don’t have the tools or electronics to work on it, so I have to drive 6 hours to fix something and spend big money on labor and parts.  If someone else besides BMW fixes something (like the brake pads) the dealer will not turn off the warning light, because they did not do the work, even though they say it was a good job.On the bright side, it gets good mileage for the performance.  It rides well, but I feel it is too soft.  The backend wiggles on slick roads when it hits a bump at speed and that can be a bit unnerving. There is a lot of room in the back with the seats folded down and have used it as a makeshift tent in bad weather (as long as the sunroof doesn’t leak).

There have been no crazy repairs needed, and it drives as good as the day we procured it.  Over time, its looks have grown on me.  I have come to really appreciate its driving characteristics, and can see why Edmunds had proclaimed it as close to a perfect car as you could buy back in 2009.  We have never put snow tires on it for winter, yet never had any problems in the snow, thanks to the xDrive.  Currently at approximately 120k miles, this car shows no signs of slowing down.

There are two VANOS solenoids - they were replaced, car ran fine for about 1,500 miles. The Problem returned, the dealer said it was the VANOS pumps, needed to be replaced. This is a very common problem with this generation of the BMW 6CYL. A costly repair. BMW has been forced to extend the warranty on this generation of 6 CYL engines due to the high VANOS failure rate over 100K miles. I was able to get most of my money reimbursed by BMW, filled out the VANOS repair recovery form - was initially rejected, but after several calls to BMW customer service I was able to the the reimbursement. It's worth the phone calls, it's your money and this is clearly a poor design. For those who would like more information on VANOS, rebuilt VANOS pumps or repair guides - http://www.drvanos.comPurchased used with 37,000 miles. Now have 97,400 miles. Up to this point no issues.

Initially, BMW changed out these components, one at a time and each time you had a check engine light come on the would replace the next most commonly malfunctioning part.

While BMW did cover the costs of the replacement and extend the warranty, having engine issue undoubtedly will lead to transmission issues. This was the case of the most recent 550i owner I met at an German auto shop while getting another vehicle pre purchase inspected. He said he spend over 10k on transmission work and eventual replacement while he owned the vehicle for only 6 months, 2 of those months was spent in the shop. These repair costs were not covered by BMW.   Some sleazy owners, will not mention this program/issue at all to you when selling the car (which was what happened in my case). Luckily the deal fell through in the 11th hour at the bank when the vehicle failed state inspection (due to worn out tires and brakes in this case). Owner claimed that both tires and brakes were replaced within the last 6 months. Some owners and used car salesmen are doing whatever they can to u load these problematic vehicles.

Read up on the internet from different owners that this is a Major problem. Now 5 months later the new set of problems is happening. Sitting in the middle of traffic the car starts sputtering and shaking then finally shuts off. All kinds of Drivetrain Malfunction, fuel sensor warnings start going off on the dash.  Called the dealer and they took care of the problem. Said it needed to be reprogrammed. A week and 1/2 later ""Same Problem"". Dealer said bring it back (reprogram issue) all takin care of for free. Picked it up and 30 minutes later the SAME PROBLEM! Now dealer has my car for 5 days. Doing more reading up on this and this is another Major problem with this car. The engines in these cars and every other car it was used in were faulty. Finding that once car is outta warranty this could cost up to $6000 a pop for these problems. Plus occasionally the oil indicator comes on saying it was low. Another problem with this car. Now i see why this car was ""discontinued"".

This 2011 535 has seen the dealership far too many times.   In a span of just over 2 years the following has occurred: keyless entry failed (multiple times), water pump failed,  AC failed,  valve cover gasket replaced,  another oil gasket leaked (last 2 were total $2,300), 2 wheels bent, 1 wheel cracked (run flats not for typical roads), sway bar replaced to name a few I recall.  Other than that, I do love this car.  X-Drive is probably better than most SUV'S out there.  Love the aggressive looks of the M-sport package.  Car is bank vault solid.  I feel very safe hauling my family in it.  I-drive is decent but not as intuitive as Acura.  Gas mileage is outstanding for such a large car (29 hwy).   Long trips I've done 34 mpg.   Power is impressive.  Hesitation from stop is there as others have written.  Very odd.  Feels like transmission is slipping.  Dealer claims it's normal.  Seems almost any brand has issues.  If you get lucky with yours,  you will love it.  BMW simply needs to simplify their electronics.  Stop the over engineering and focus on building a solid car again.

Almost $10,000 down the drain plus whatever amount that car has devalued from use. First of all, let me just confirm the complaints about the tires I see from other reviewers. They are a total nightmare! I have the receipts for 14 tires that I have replaced in the last 5 months. I bought 4 brand new tires at almost $500 bucks each after my first two flats. 1 had a bubble and subsequently popped within 24 hours of having it installed. I had it replaced with a new tire using the road hazard warranty and within a week, the two front tires blew out again. At that point I was driving scared and being extremely careful not to hit any bumps. Ive owned 2 door coupes with 19"" wheels and thin tires and never had this problem. I even tried getting tires with a bigger sidewall to see if the extra cushioning would help and it only made things worse. The Car started to have an issue with the transfer case. According to the dealership the car has to use the specific tire measurements that come with the car or the transfer case gets confused when doling out power to the wheels. So basically I had no choice but to keep replacing the crappy run flat tires that costs $500. Ludicrous, I am trading in the car because the money I will lose from purchasing the extended warranty , does not add up to the cost of constantly replacing these tires. Other issues I had in my short time with the car are:The windshield fluid stopped working and pump had to be replaced. iDrive controller completely stopped working so the entire infotainment system was uncontrollable. Driver seat kept causing a warning that it could not be calibrated. Radio kept having a strange feedback noise at high volumes.All of these problems are minor issues that could easily be fixed by the very attentive and pleasant BMW staff at the service center. They were great and very pleasurable to work with. However it takes a month just to get an appointment at any BMW dealer in the New York area and some dealerships don't offer loaners unless you purchased the car from them.  When I went to the Service Center I was shocked, They had over a 500 Cars on the lot for repairs. Ive never seen anything like it. I previously had an infiniti and never had to wait for a service appointment or worry about getting a loaner. Not to mention the Inifiniti facilities are infinitely (no pun intended) better than anything I've seen from BMW. To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement. Im trading the Car in and trying out an Audi A7 or a Benz CLS.

Improved handling, acceleration, steering, shifting, braking. This is what I feel BMW does best. Unfortunately, there are some serious negatives. The front seats are very uncomfortable. These are true bucket seats. There is a central depression in the seat bottom and the sides come up to hold you in place. However, they press on your hips and after an hour or so, can be annoying. I am 5'10, 180 pounds. There should be a choice of seating. In regards to the electronics, I have to say that the distance controls when parking are great, as they were in my previous car. Downside here is that there are too many sub menus, pull downs, too difficult to adjust things. Standard radio speakers just adequate, should be excellent at this price. Why the need to get the upgraded stereo? Sound was better in a Ford Fusion I recently rented. In my old car, there was a knob on the central dash to control heat/cold thru upper vents. On the new one, have to go to climate menu to adjust. I guess my main complaint regards the seating. Performance in driving excellent. One other comment, it has a tracking device that can be engaged to steer the car, as long as your hand is on the wheel. This does not work well. It appears to operate where there are clear lines on the road. However, on a turn, it wanders from one side of the land and then corrects to the other, requiring constant driver input.",4,2018," BMW 5 Series Sedan 530i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

The first two were pretty reliable although on one I had to have one of the injector port replaced.  In January of 2018 I leased the third, an M550i Xdrive.  It's nice looking, is pretty quick and it's fun to drive.  I took possession in the winter and around April I noticed the AC didn't cool...just blew hot air.  I took it in to the dealer who charged up the system and kept it for a week looking for leaks.  Didn't find any.  Car was returned and enjoyed great AC until late June.  Just today (June 24th) the AC went from cold air to cool and finally warm in less than an hour.  Now I have to make a long hot drive to bring the car back in to the dealer next week.  I get a loaner but it's an inferior model (except for the AC).  I've only had the car for 180 days but I'm already half way to officially being able to declare the vehicle a Lemon under Texas law.  Two other annoying things are the music connection and the wireless charging.  For music I mostly use Pandora through my iPhone X.  The connection to the car is unreliable and I generally have to restart my phone to get it to play.  I've used both the BMW app and Apple Car Play.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the $300 Car Play option.  The wireless charger is hit and miss as well.  I've used two phones that are Qi charger capable and both sometimes work in the car and sometimes don't.  They both charge perfectly on the wireless charger at home.   In summary the car drives well, but the AC and the electronics problems make the car a poor choice if you're a driver who wants his $90,000 car to work as advertised.

I drive mostly on the highway (between LA and San Diego) and get typically 700 miles per 17.4-gallon tank.  Further, the torque of the diesel, which is about 80% greater than the 530i, allows a much smoother ride as there is much less downshifting for passing or hills.

For the first time in my life I was in the market for a car for myself after having hauled around kids for 20 plus years in mini-vans.  I had narrowed it down to 3 cars: Audi A4, Mercedes C250 ad the BMW 3 series.  My son and I test drove the A4 and C250, and liked the performance of the A4, but weren't crazy about the interior.  The Mercedes in my opinion failed on all levels, too cramped, quality of materials were poor, performance, and overall ride quality.  After that my son was suggesting a Dodge Charger or Chrysler 300, I just wasn't in the market for something that big, and I had test driven a 320 a couple of months back, I liked the 320, but overall performance was below my expectations, so we took the drive to go test drive a CPO BMW 328i.  Within 30 seconds of driving the 328, we knew this was no 320, and this was the car I had been looking for.  It is a rocket!!!  The ride, handling and performance exceeded my expectations.  What I love about it the most is the 3 driving styles you can select from: Eco, for maxing out your fuel economy, Comfort, good fuel economy plus some performance, or sport, max speed and fun, it'll get to 80 in no time, hard to believe this is a 4 cylinder, the turbo is great, its a single turbo, but tuned for low and high speeds, so you can take off quick, or if your on the highway have plenty of get up to pass.  I also really like the fuel economy you can get out of the car, I'm getting 40 MPG at 70mph, granted flat surface in FL, but that is some serious MPG.  Oh yeah, the car looks great too. Roomy as well, I'm 6'1"" and fit comfortably.  So if you in the market for a smaller German sedan I highly recommend the 328.   Not sure about the reliability as I've only had it for a few weeks, but under warranty until 2020.  CPO is the way to go.It's been 6 months since I've had the car and am still enjoying it.

I love the way I can put it into eco-pro mode on the freeways and notch up 35 mpg and better on long drives and then - when I want to leave other drivers well behind - I can slip it into sport mode and boom! I am gone. The one drawback is a lousily small amount of storage space for the driver.

This is my first BMW and I must say I love this car.The car has an excellent combination of a comfortable ride and good handling.  The handling is not as sharp as the older style BMW 3 series, but its good for driving around town and maybe taking a corner or two at higher speeds.  The snow traction with the AWD is awesome.The Navigation system is the best I have ever seen.  Everything makes perfect sense and it works extremely well.  I love the fact that I can write letters with my fingers on the touch pad and it recognized them.  The navigation interface is the best of any cars I have owned by far.The Bluetooth menu takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it, it is easy to use.  It locks to my Android phone very quickly and phone conversations are clear via Bluetooth. Put the car in Eco mode and it is a pussycat just minding its own business and getting you from point A to point B in style.  Switch it to Sport mode and the car turns into a little monster pinning you back into your seat as you step on the accelerator.I have the premium package with Navigation and the winter package.  My kids love the heated rear seats in NE winter.The interior of this car is in need of an update to keep up with the new Audi and Mercedes interior.  But it is perfectly functional and looks good.  I wish that the climate control would remember the last fan settings and would not always start in the same mode.  I have to change the fan setting every time I turn the engine on.  The mileage for around town driving is in the low 20s, but highway is above 30 in Eco mode and if you keep your speeds around 60 MPH.  It is hard to drive 60 MPH on the highway with this car though as it is so smooth and quiet even at 90 MPH.I have not had a single mechanical or electrical problem with the car that required repairs.  It is under bumper to bumper warranty for 4 years of 40K miles.  It also includes free maintenance in that duration.  The Audi only provides free maintenance for 1 yr or 10K miles.I have owned Hondas and Toyotas prior to this BMW.

"1705",2016-01-18,"Wilson","2014 BMW 3 Series Wagon 328i xDrive 4dr Wagon AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","Sportwagon - Child Seat Comments included!","I spent the better part of a frigid New England (just snowed) morning test driving two cars 1) a 2014 BMW 328xi wagon with luxury package and 2) a new 2015 BMW 328xd wagon with nav and a couple of the basic packages. I had never driven a diesel before so I felt I owed it to myself to try these two head-to-head. While the diesel had a broadly useable torque band, I felt it lacked uphill oomph especially in the 2nd or 3rd gear range (tough to tell because the transmission shifts so smoothly in both models). Granted this was a 25 degree day and we basically started it cold from the dealership, but after having driven a similarly cold gasoline model over the same roads earlier in the morning, the diesel just didn’t compare. In my opinion, the diesel was overpriced even with the 2015 “leftover” discount, about $7k more than the lightly used 2014 with 10k miles. The diesel exhaust note, as many reviews have noted, is coarse and loud at revs. The gasoline exhaust note is fake, pumped in through the sound system. You can actually hear it change its volume if you switch from Comfort to Sport under hard acceleration. Still, I prefer a quiet car with some audio theatrics to one that sounds like an economy car with gravel under the hood.Now for some comments that pertain to both models:1)	Very few reviews ever cover the fit and functionality of child seats. The local used car dealership graciously allowed me to mess around with different configurations after I test drove it. I am 6’0 and need to use a fair amount of front seat track to get comfortable behind the wheel. In the rear-facing position, I found the child seat to be workable, but it took a fair amount of finagling. Both test cars were equipped with power front seats rather than the manual kind found in some of the base models. For 6’0+ drivers, you might have to live with your seatback a little more upright than you’re used to in order to get the child seat to fit correctly in the rear-facing position. I also found it helped to drop the driver’s seat almost to the floor. In the front-facing position, there were no problems at all.Now, I didn’t try one of our newer child seats – a Britax G3 Marathon. Those stay in my wife’s minivan since she does 90% of the child transportation. They are a bit more bulky, mostly laterally, than the regular G3 because they have the extra head protection. With BMW’s new 40-20-40 folding seatbacks, you might be able to utilize your “20” with two regular G3s in the back, but you’d have a much harder time doing the same thing with the wider G3 Marathons.2)	The stock stereo system is middling. Not sure the upgrade would necessarily be worth it, but it could be worth considering.3)	Despite some criticism of the new suspension, I found the Sport mode in both models to be amply stiff for hard corners in slippery conditions. Yes, I did try a couple after dropping off my sales minder at the front door.4)	Visibility out the back is limited and the side mirrors are tiny. Unfortunately, this means springing for blind-spot detection is a must.5)	After half an hour in the standard seats, I wasn’t loving them. The seat bottoms are totally flat with just average padding. They reminded me of the mid-90s Subaru Outback wagon seats. Both my testers had lumbar support, which even for me as a relatively healthy mid-30s guy is a must. I would probably limit my search to models with the sport seats from here out.6)	The new touch-sensitive controller is little too sensitive for the initiated, but I found myself accidentally clicking stuff when I was trying to use the jogger control.7)	Overall, I don’t think either of these models is worth the near $50k price tag, but finding a lightly used CPO at <$40k seems right for the gasoline-powered model. The diesel model really doesn’t warrant a premium, but my commutes most days are fairly short so I’m probably not the target market for it.",4,2014," BMW 3 Series Wagon 328i xDrive 4dr Wagon AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

This car replaced a 2007 328xi that I traded in after 180K miles (loved that car too).  I consider the 328d a bridge between regular gas engines and an electric vehicle; the mileage is so fantastic, I feel just as smug as the Prius drivers as I pass them on the highway, knowing I'm sipping fuel at a slower rate than them at highway speeds.  Acceleration is not the reason you buy this car, but getting up to speed is effortless, with the low RPMs and fast-shifting transmission getting you to full highway speed without a worry.  Handling and breaking are, as typical for a BMW 3 Series, second to none.  I'm now a stranger to gas stations, as I usually go 550-600 miles between fill-ups.  Although many don't like run-flats, I absolutely love them, and they've saved me from many bad situations in the past.  They are well worth the extra replacement cost, given the peace of mind that they provide. I'm 6'4"", and that's probably pushing max height for a BMW 3 Series driver...however, the car is still very comfortable for me, even on long trips.

These BMW 328d have very few mechanical issues unlike 2009-2011 335d, which were known for expensive fuel injector/pump, carbon buildup and DEF/EGR problems. I fill up with Propel HPR diesel, a 100% renewable diesel (way better than bio-diesel) available in most cities in CA, which will help keep this 328d very reliable for many years (look up HPR diesel online, I tested it on my TDI before, it's a superb clean diesel alternative). Fuel economy is way better than EPA rating at cruising speed - I get 52-54 mpg at 73-75 mph, (high 50's! when cruising at 55-65 mph) - I average 39-44 on each tank (600+ miles) depending on what % is city driving & how aggressively I drive - that's the fuel economy of a Toyota hybrid. Considering the great handling and how much fun it is to drive (280 lb. ft. of torque), this BMW is a winner! I bought my 328d certified pre-owned from BMW of Marin County with an extended warranty (2 years, unlimited miles) which gives me a peace of mind as I drive 3K/month all over NorCal. The 8 speed ZF transmission is smooth and quick shifting in either sport or comfort mode: I've owned many BMW's with 5 & 6 speed transmission and this 8 speed is the best. Interestingly enough, I searched for 328d for 3 months and paid less for very clean low mileage Certified 328d than private parties were asking, which shows how high the demand is for these reliable diesels.

If all you're looking for in a vehicle is engineering and performance, then BMW is definitely for you.  The 2.0L Turbo 4 is a powerful little engine which is smooth as silk and provides sprightly acceleration, especially in Sport mode.  I'll even forgive the fact that it sounds like a low-end diesel mill at idle.  But BMWs come by their sticker price by virtue of their reputation and position in the luxury segment.  Upgrading the technology, luxury and safety components comes at a steep price.  To get something as basic as a backup camera (standard equipment in most cars now), you need to tack on a $900 Driver Assistance Package, and active monitoring features come in another $1700 package.  I'm probably going to trade this car soon for a small SUV and need to try and justify whether I want to fork over another $16 to $18K above my trade-in for an X3 which will have less than half the comfort and safety equipment of many other worthy contenders in the segment at thousands less.

Overall, this vehicle met my needs and after reading countless reviews (consumer and professional) the 340i remained in my top three narrowed down selection. My personal needs for a vehicle required performance, luxury, AWD (due to the snowy winters in Chicago), and decent gas mileage (sub par mpg with my last vehicle, 2012 Dodge Charger SRT8). My 340i is equipped with the cold weather package ($800), driver assistance package ($950), M sport package ($2,600), technology package ($2,750), and the track handling package ($1,700). $8,800 for those added options is very steep in my opinion but after getting a good trade-in value along with very low APR financing, as well as a tax credit and 4 years free maintenance I felt that it all balanced out. As for my impression of the vehicle, let me start off with the interior. Although many people tend to favor the interiors of Cadillac, Audi, Mercedes, Lexus, etc...the BMW interior is still very nice and luxurious. I can understand if some people think it's beginning to appear a bit dated, but nonetheless it's still superior to many vehicles on the market. The Dakota leather sport seats are top notch quality and for the most part above average in terms of comfort. The anthracite headliner, aluminum and gloss black trim accents throughout the vehicle along with the ambient lighting (which is dimmable) all go together fairly nicely. The cabin is really quiet and there are no rattle like noises or unwanted vibrations. The exterior of the vehicle is the best looking to date for the 3 series sedan in my opinion. From the elegant lines on the hood and the minor refresh of the whole body in general gives the vehicle a great sporty look that is very tasteful but not overstated or too flashy. I opted for the black sapphire metallic paint and the 19"" alloy orbit grey M sport wheels along with black kidney grilles complete the overall look. Now on to the performance. Let me tell you, this car can move and it is fast! It doesn't exactly give you the ""throw you back in your seat"" kind of feeling and I must admit I do miss that and all the rear wheel glory and torque of my previous SRT8, but I still experience an ultimate thrill and satisfaction while driving this car. The 8 speed automatic transmission is flawless. The AWD has a tenacious grip on the road and you feel like you have complete control at all times. I prefer to drive in the sport mode setting regularly as it is always responsive and ready to accelerate hard at any time. The start/stop fuel saver system is very intrusive and can be deactivated with a push of a button and I never use it. I have a lead foot and most of my driving is in the city and I'm averaging 16 mpg which for me is acceptable especially considering the performance you get with the 3.0 liter twin turbo V-6. I've read that 0-60 mph can be as low as 4.4 seconds which I don't doubt depending on the conditions and where you live of course. The adaptive M suspension is great, but comfort does suffer a bit if you're selecting the sport modes. The low profile run flat tires detract from the comfort too, but nothing that isn't tolerable. The handling on this car is great too. So much that it almost feels like you're driving a coupe. Although this is a sedan, it feels so light and steering it is so effortless without taking away from the overall driving experience. The M sport brakes are phenomenal and feel perfect and smooth (not too sensitive and not too soft) when I need to apply my foot to the pedal. I also really like the sound of the dual exhaust when I drive in sport mode. You'll definitely hear the ""crackles and pops"" when revving the engine and when you accelerate hard and ease off the gas pedal. I always look forward to getting behind the wheel of this car and just letting it open up on the road. But let me tell you, this car isn't perfect. I do have a few gripes with it. Mostly with the knob control of the display screen. It can get quite annoying. Turn the knob to scroll here, click this and click that, hit the back button to exit, and on and on. So many times I want to be able to just touch the screen and get to what I want with ease but I can't. I knew this beforehand of course and was willing to deal with it. Connecting your iPod or iPhone via Bluetooth or with a cable isn't the best in terms of integration with this vehicle either. The interface definitely needs some tweeking. For example, let's say you connect your phone via Bluetooth so you can play your music. Accessing playlists or trying to shuffle songs is not easy when dealing with the knob turn dial control. And with the lack of a touch screen, you can't just select what you want with ease. If you've had a Nissan/Infiniti or a Dodge, their infotainment systems are much better. Lack of a touch screen and remote start at this price point is disappointing.",4,2016," BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

I had a 2010 328i sedan and loved the performance.  I have also driven the 2016 328i as a service loaner and was very impressed.  When I first considered the 2016 320i it was with a lot of skepticism about the reduced horsepower compared to the 328.  I am so glad I took it for a test drive.  The acceleration is better than I expected, especially in Sport mode.  I have an X3 with the 2.0 L Turbo and I would say the 320 in Sport mode is about as fast as the X3.  Highway driving is great.  I was cruising at over 80 mph and it seemed effortless.  The handling and ride is excellent.  It is everything you would expect in a BMW. The steering is precise.  It can turn and stop on a dime.  For those who are used to other luxury brands like Lexus or Mercedes, it may not be what you are used to.  BMW owners will feel right at home.  The car has fantastic leg room in the back seat (better than Audi A3 or A4 in my experience) and a huge trunk.  It is a great combination of practicality with sportiness.  Gas mileage is better than what I am getting on my X3.  My only complaint is that the seats seem a little flat, but they are good enough.  The Sport Package seats are better.  I saved around $5,000 versus the 328 and it is money well-saved.  The 328 is noticeably better in initial acceleration, but the 320 is a better value in my opinion.  Both are excellent cars.UPDATE:  We have had the car for 2 years now.  The car continues to perform very well.  The only problem we have had is a leak in the Condenser that the dealership told me was caused by road debris.  It was a tiny nick but caused all of the refrigerant to leak out.

"1754",2016-03-08,"Whoever","2016 BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)","Competing with pro review on 340ix","I thought it might be useful for someone to get a more detailed review of this car based on personal experience of owning it and at the same time comparing it with other cars owed or tested. When somebody tells me 'I love my car, its great' it generally tells me very little. I heard that from the owners of KIA or Prius or Tahoe and other cars that I personally would try to avoid. They all have something good about them (if only the price) and are better than any car produced in India, for example, but that does not tell me exactly how these cars are  really better or worse than others. And that's the only thing that really matters, for me at least. So here it goes.I bought my new 340ix aboumonths ago and have about 1500miles on it now. Before that I owned for 3.5 years 335is coupe, before that Mercedes 320 Sport Edition and my wife owns (so me too to a degree) new Z4 35i and before that z4 35 sport and before that z3. Before getting into 340ix, while thinking of either re-leasing or replacing my 335is I tried BMW 435i, M325, 335i, M3, Mercedes c450amg, Audi4 and 5 and RS, Hyundai Genesis and that are all the cars (not to mention my experiences with rental Toyotas, VW, Chevrolet, Nissan and bunch of others) that I can compare. First, none of the tried cars were worth switching to from my 335is. With exception of M3. Which would go beyond what I was willing to pay. So finally arriving of the new 340ix did it. It matched engine power with 335is, it had x drive which I found attractive (335is was not fun driving around ski resorts), it had a couple of luxury items I'd like to have and it was a new car I could have for almost the same lease money. So what did I get? Considering I paid for M package, Track package, Park assist and ignored Navigation altogether. Actually, not one but four cars with very distinct personalities. Consequence of track and M packages that provide several different modes of driving which are really something very noticeable, not just on paper statements. On other cars I tried and on my wife's Z4 those are also present, nothing new, but while you can feel the difference on other cars I feel its rather much more dramatic on 340ix. So, starting with these modes:First, they indeed can be useful and I do switch between them in different conditions. Second, I cant say I'm particularly happy about them. I would be perfectly fine with one perfectly tuned suspension and steering. Which was the case in my 2012 335iS, frankly having the ideally  tuned suspension and steering, better than any other car I tried so far (better even than in M3 and maybe better than Porsche Boxter). I don't know how they managed that but they did with 335is - exceptionally smooth, absorbing all the major road imperfection and at the same time razor sharp with just heavy enough and firm steering to feel the road and keep things under absolute control. Simply a joy to drive. Why BMW would not just stick with it?? People just keep saying that new BMW cars generation lost this handling edge but BMW stubbornly ignores that. And these modes are:1. ECO Pro - it could be even Eco Pro Pro or super pro or whatever else BMW marketing call them there would still be nothing 'Pro' here. This mode turns your BMW into Toyota Primus. It reduces the engine response to the gas pedal and add a bunch of indicators on display to let you sort of play some computer game, giving some saved miles bonuses, plots and tips, etc. Warning if you press too hard on accelerator pedal or exceed some speed limits. I played around with it while breaking in the car but frankly I can't see what an idiot (pardon) would buy BMW to drive it in Eco mode. 2. Comfort mode - that mode is actually better than on 335 or Z4. It feels a little firmer and more steerable. But still not what I would consider providing a good BMW-like driving experience. It provides reasonable engine output (press the pedal and you really go) and its smooth but IMHO a little bobbing on bumps and the steering is just too overpowered and soft which makes you a little nervous on high speeds. I still use it in rush hour and maybe its OK to use on gravel roads or something. But its still nowhere close to the standard 335is experience, worse than Z4 comfort mode and I would even prefer Mercedes 320Sport driving to that. It reminds me Buick leSabre on steroids. The worst part of it - its a default mode. You cant change it. Why??? Both Audi and Mercedes let you choose whats default, its all software. Mercedes even let you customize the parameters of the mode to choose your preferences. Why am I forced to drive in comfort mode the car most would buy for sporty behavior? That's plain stupid. Its the same on Z4.  So if you bought the car not to show that you can buy luxury car but to indeed enjoy performance ride then you need not to forget to hit the mode button every time you start engine. That will give you a Sport mode. 3. Sport mode increases the responsiveness of the engine,",5,2016," BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

It's my first BMW, comfortable, quick, and very smooth. I wanted a compact car, but I also wanted a solid car that looks good, and is safe, reliable, and fun to drive.  The 320xi has plenty of power for me. It took 800 plus miles on the engine until I could feel it begin to break in. The design is very pleasing to the eye -- exterior & interior. The controls are logical, and easy use. I have the Sensatec faux leather which I think is excellent. I prefer it over leather in some ways, mostly because I think leather has a strange smell. I think it is a good quality, solid car, and a good value for the money. Excellent build quality. I did, however, trade it in for a Mercedes Benz E350, that has more comfortable seats and doesn't ride so low. (I traded the E350 for a Porsche Macan, that I think has a more heavy duty suspension, and more comfortable seats.) I have two negative opinions: First, no spare tire came with the car, and I'm not comfortable with that; and second, I found it difficult to get in and out of the 320xi, and the seats gave me a back ache.

This time I decided to get a CPO 2012 328i. I have had the car for about 45 days; it has been in the shop for 15 of those days. It needed: A NEW TIMING BELT (after I was told that the blender-like noise the engine was making was ""normal"" until I took it back to the dealer to investigate it further), an new window regulator, a new seat belt latch, re-charged AC, and crack in the instrument panel plastic covering the instruments. A week later I had to take it BACK because the steering wheel was making a load groaning noise when turned, and the stereo intermittently recognizes that I have a CD in the player or my iPhone connected to the USB. Sometimes I have to go without music on the wonderful upgraded Harmon Kardon stereo until the system decides to reset itself. The dealership still cannot diagnose this issue. Also, the only way to drive this car is to leave it in ""Sport"" mode. The default ""Comfort"" mode makes the car feel like a 1980's-era Cadillac-all floaty and bouncy on the highway. Steering and  handling are tops in Sport mode, though. Overall I'm disappointed in the quality. I had the 2006 325i for 5 years, and had ZERO issues other than the sunroof not wanting to close from time to time. I put 102,000 miles on it and only did basic maintenance-no unexpected warranty visits. Thank tha LAWD I got the extended warranty with this CPO (Certified Piece Of _____).

Having lived in Germany for a decade, all I did was fix up and drive BMWs, Mercedes, and Porsches. My current BMW is an 06 330i for which I was seeking a newer replacement. Since 2012, the 3 series has went to electronic steering. The car no longer transmits ""road feel"". If you push it in a corner, it no longer feeds the driver input that makes a sports car a sports car--it doesn't matter what mode (sports, comfort, etc it is set in) The brakes have a regeneratative feature that makes them clunky--they have lost their ability for the driver to modulate them--just like the steering. The engine exhaust note is lacking, especially when the biturbo is kicked in. It kind of sounds like a metal trash can with some marbles rolling around in it--when you get deep into the throttle, the 300hp being unleashed should have a growl and not sound like a muffled trash can with marbles. The rest of the car is classic BMW, the ergonomics are what has made the 3 series a Road and Track and Motor Trend car of the year winner in its class since its production--that has not changed. It has beautiful lines, beautiful interior appointments, and another 80 more horsepower than my current 06. One of the new technology enhancement I like is the heads up display--it also has simplified GPS info--only the turn in so many miles/ft--just what is needed on the windshield--the rest is still on the main display. Overall, I won't be buying. I could change the exhaust--but I can't change the brakes or steering which are so important to a sports car feel. BMW has tried to have an appeal to a broader audience and has left its enthusiast drivers sort of wanting more.

The car is F.A.S.T! If I need to get around someone on the freeway, I barely even touch the gas pedal, and i'm in front of them. The gas mileage is great, considering I have a lead foot (average freeway speed is 80 mph). Also, the seats are the most comfortable seats I have a had in a luxury car. And trust me, all my life I have owned luxury vehicles (Range Rovers, other BMWs, Mercedes, and even Audis). The iDrive is AMAZING! I owned the 2007 BMW 750Li when it came out, and holy crap did the iDrive suck! It great now! Now the cons. Resale value is horrible!

And heading back to cons, the rear seats aren't that comfortable if you don't have the heated rear seats option (I do but my friend has a 2014 328Xi with no heated rear seats).

There are noticeable improvements in shifting smoothness ( 6 spd manual), although maybe it's me that is breaking in to the car.   This car is plenty fast (for me, anyway) and a great, quiet cruiser.   Just for fun, I reset the computer after getting on 95 for a trip up to NJ.  With a steady 70 mph on cruise control, the consumption was an average of 43 mpg over approx. 100 miles.  Granted, that is purely just a 70 mph cruise with no stopping or much accelerating, except for tolls and pit stops, but it is an eye-opener when you look at that display.  Around the suburban area where I live, the mileage hovers around 30 mpg.   My usual drive mode is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, then 6th gears, revving to about 3000-3500 in 1st and 2nd.  Not exactly a feather foot.Recently, at 20000 miles through an allowed 45000 miles on my lease, and halfway through the time of the lease, I took off and saved the run flat tires.   They will be reinstalled when I return the car.  The new Michelin pilot sport ps 3 plus all season tires make a huge difference, like going from square to round tires.   The rolling resistance is far less (I can push the car with one hand).  It is tranformed into a quiet, fast, road eater.  I added a can of slime and a small air compressor in case of a flat.  This is common on higher performance cars like the BMW M and some Mustangs. I highly recommend this change.",5,2015," BMW 3 Series Sedan 320i 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"
"1792",2015-07-10,"Don Noveau","2015 BMW 3 Series Sedan 320i 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)","Gotta have it (?)","Black on Black 320i with manual 6 speed, Sport, Premium and Driver Assistance packages, plus heated front seats.  I've had it for two weeks and less than 500 miles.  I traded in a 2013 Honda Accord Sport CVT.  The Honda had accumulated some equity in the lease, so it went back 5 months early; the dealer paid it all off (residual and 5 payments) leaving a zero balance against the BMW lease.  Impressive for Honda.  .In several ways, I miss the Honda:  the ""infotainment"" was better.  The BMW  does not have a Pandora source in its system.  Yes, it will stream music, but you control it from the smartphone, not through the car.    Rebound control seemed better than the BMW, especially for the rear. I really liked the CVT. ( I don't like automatic transmissions with gears, so I got the manual BMW.)The BMW gas mileage in suburban traffic seems about the same as the Accord, which was excellent:  26 to 40 mpg.  Power seems similar also, but the BMW is MUCH quieter and smoother, so it's hard to tell. The BMW certainly seems to have enough power, but it's not a racer.  (I purposely looked for a low-powered BMW to save on traffic tickets, based on past experience with other BMWs.  This is the primary reason why the 320i attracted me - it's sensible and well balanced.) But when you consider that the BMW lease payment is just $6 more than the Honda payment (although I did kick in a little cash to cover tax and tags), and that it has far more premium features than the Honda did, not to mention all that comes with the BMW brand, The BMW Club, you see the advantage. I'm looking forward to ""growing into"" the BMW as it breaks in.ONE YEAR LATER:   After 14,000 miles, I wouldn't change much about what I wrote previously.   However, this car is GOOD on gas.  33-36 around suburbia, and 42 at 70 MPH on cruise, over a 150 mile trip.  I've done that trip several times.  There are no rattles of any kind.  It still doesn't seem fast, but high speed cruising (80+) is excellent, when possible and safe.  But I still miss the Honda sometimes, and probably will take another look at that brand in two more years.  If I ever get another BMW, I probably won't choose to get the sport seats - they make getting into the car more difficult than it needs to be.  This car is a 2015 model.  Handling is good, not not appreciably better in feel than my old Accord.  I'm sure that if put on a racetrack, the BMW would go around faster than the Accord, but in daily driving, they feel nearly the same.  I understand there were some suspension improvements on the 2016.At 20000 miles, I put on Michelin pilot sport as 3 plus non run flat tires. I saved the old continental run flats to put back on for lease end.  They have plenty of tread.  With the michelins, it's like going from square to round to put it simply.   What a difference.  If I do get a flat, I have an inexpensive can of Slime and a compressor.  If I ever get another car with summer run flat tires, I'll make this change in week one.  Otherwise I stand by my previous comments.27000 Miles:   I also have a 1997 Z3 that I have renovated.  Lately, I'm choosing to drive it over the 320i.  It just drives better even though it uses a lot more gas.   I'm looking forward to the end of the 320i lease so that I can find another used BMW to fix up.    Still, the 320 is a great car for long trips.35000 miles:   Ditto the last comments above.  It’s an excellent car that feels like it would last another 20 years with no problem.  I’m wondering about my lease mileage choice (15,000/year).  I have 6 months left to drive 10,000 miles.  Either I set off across the country, or turn the car in with significant unused miles.  I tried out a 2018 Accord.  If I do get a new car, that will be it.  Looking at residual value, this 320i would cost $24,999 to buy.  It does have special equipment, but similar 320’s are already available for $23,000 full retail price, and with less mileage.   That’s the same price range as a brand new Accord Sport.  I think Ill just use the Z3 as my daily driver for a while, or pick up a used 8-10 year old Bimmer for $ mid-teens.  The brand does still have exclusivity.FINA Review:  As promised above, I found a 2002 BMW 330ci convertible with 59000 miles.  For $7,000.   It was a local car, too.   After purchase, I added a Bluetooth device, did a LOT of cosmetic cleanup and painting in the interior, refinished the leather seats, had quite a few dents taken out by paintless dent repair, replaced all four rotors and pads with ceramic pads (no dust), Painted the wheels and the rear bumper, and now have a very respectable $9,000 car that should be reliable for quite some time.   I returned the 320i three months early to save on insurance.  So, the overall review of the 320i is “meh”.",4,2015," BMW 3 Series Sedan 320i 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

Perfect for long trips if you don't need to bring the kitchen sink. Easy to drive 600 miles or more and not be beat up by the road or traffic in the process. Plenty of pep. The torque presents a very punchy engine that was a big surprise during my demo. The mileage estimates are more than fair.

I found a  very nice one owner 328XI with 60k on the clock. I had the car one week before the troubles started. The car decided to Randomly start, Hot ,Cold it didn't matter. Took the car to a certified BMW repair facility and was told it was a fuel pump, and or possibly fuel relay. Cost $1500 to  replace both components. I declined bought both parts offline and put them in ($300). Problem was it didn't fix the car so back on the wrecker it went. (Did I mention Car spends lots of time on a wrecker). New shop new diagnosis, bad DMI Board. The DMI board fixed the problem. Nothing on these cars are cheap to fix, this repair with reprogramming was $1300.00. All was good for about 2 weeks and the car literally quit running at 50 MPH  (no power steering -no brakes to speak of)  Again on the wrecker it went. Diagnosis bad battery and programming issues. Ok, a Battery no big deal $240 for the battery $100.00 to program it (No, you can't just swap batteries in newer BMWs ) and of course $100 to put battery in (Labor) so  roughly $450.00 for a new battery. All was good for about 3 months. The car was excellent in the snow a pleasure to drive. performance unequaled to anything else I've owned.  Gas mileage is excellent fora performance car. I'm thinking finally got the bugs out of it,really enjoying it AND BAM total shutdown AGAIN at 45 MPH. On the wrecker again 3rd time in less than 7months. Diagnosis the computer decided it didn't want to talk to the car. To fix the car needs to be completely reprogrammed another $500 with towing. The repair shop did tell me though BMW is aware of cars losing communication with the ECU. (service Bulletin) They seem to be aware of a lot of the problems their  cars have. They like the word ""service bulletin"" basically we have a problem(s) with such and such, but you will have to pay to have it fixed. Recalls? this car has 3-- one major that could result in a fire (Heater Motor) I guess it will burn as BMW in my area has no parts to fix recall, unknown when they will receive them.  These stories are all over the web like mine. Remember this is a 60k one owner car that is about as reliable as a watch with a dead battery.

"1809",2017-01-30,"Len D","2008 BMW 3 Series Sedan 335xi 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M)","High maintenance, but high satisfaction too!","Bought my '08 about sixteen months ago (May 2015). It was pristine with only 38k miles on it then and still runs and looks like new today, now having almost 47k miles on the odometer. It has Cold Weather, Premium and Sports packages, 6-spd manual. The run-flats were ditched by the previous owner and despite the extra weight over the nose from AWD it carves corners like a Ginsu knife with quick, responsive steering; highly tossable. Yet it also has that legendary combination of sporty handling with ride comfort, although being the 3-series it does tend to follow road perturbations more than it absorbs them, making the ride along PA's crappy roads 'busier' than I'd like at times. The car has that classic German horsepower swell where, the further along the tach the needle goes, the harder it seems to pull; third gear it's nearly frighteningly quick and I swear it has way more than 'just' 300 hp. 	All that said, I keep my fingers crossed every time I get in it. Three months after getting it, it stranded me; I had to have its third high-pressure fuel pump installed at under 40k miles. Thankfully, BMW had years before acknowledged the problem and extended the warranty on that specific part to ten years or 120k miles, which means I’m on my own in another fifteen months. Still, warranty or not, three fuel pumps in under 40k miles is a joke. And then there are the dainty little piezo fuel injectors that also reputedly might have a short life and the twin turbo wate-gates and of course, the self-imploding water pump (every 55k miles!). The tech at my local BMW dealer, as well as the owner of the indie BMW shop I take it to, both tell me that the N54 in-line 6 is “..the best engine BMW ever made..” and that its foibles are grossly exaggerated on the internet. The dealer tech was able to tell through the BMW database that my specific car had “..already had the injectors addressed..” at around 20k miles although he was unable to explain exactly what that meant, and so he assured me I was “..good to go..”. I hope they’re both right.	But even if they are, that still leaves me with the frequent and expensive maintenance charges. I spread-sheeted the planned expenditures according to my much-trusted indie shop’s schedule for the car, (which BTW includes changing differential and xfer case oil that BMW claims never needs changing; yeah, right!). Including the guaranteed-to-fail water-pump, it’s going to cost me about $1,000/yr to keep her maintained and running ‘like a BMW’. The online BMW forums dismiss this as ‘..pay-to-play..’ and the cost of ‘being in the club’. I suppose that’s really not so bad, but if the other of its notorious bits start to ‘pop’ it’ll be a LOT worse than that. Frankly I’m shopping for something less fussy to maintain and repair, while keeping my fingers crossed. The problem is, once you’ve become spoiled by the car’s unparalleled combination of power, handling and comfort (for a 4-door sedan anyway), most every other sedan feels inferior by comparison. Darn Germans!!UPDATE 8/1/2017So as predicted, the car has cost me about $1,200 each year to 'maintain'. Maybe in 2017 that's not so bad?...$100/month? It still gripes me. I'm just over 49k miles now and the dreaded $1,200 water pump 'guaranteed failure' is within the next 10k miles, and possibly the 'walnut blast' to blow the carbon deposits off the valves abused by the direct injection system. But the car itself? Wow. No complaints with how it drives, the engne's power and smoothness. Like I said before, road perturbations throw it around more than I like but it does handle crisply, like a good BMW should. Bluetooth still sucks. Lately the car has taken to deciding on its own whether or not it's in a good enough mood to 'pair' with my phone when I get in the car. When it works it's fine, when it works. Infiniti had this perfected in 2007. What's up with this BMW?      I'm not sure I'm going to keep it. The primary thing keeping me in the car right now is its very low miles and 'like new' condition, and also the fact that stickshifts are getting harder and harder to find. But not impossible, so I'm leaning in the direction of parting ways. My wife's '05 Audi S4 has actually required less maintenance than this thing craves. If you absolutely must have the blue and white rounded in your driveway, this vintage of BMW will not disappoint, and so long as you're prepared to dump that kind of money into it on a yearly basis, go find one and have fun. For me, the jury's still out but BMW's 'ownership model' is not looking good to me lately.UPDATE 8/2/2018She’s gone! Sent to a good home in NY. Couldn’t stand the ‘time-bomb-ticking’ I kept hearing in my head. I ‘settled’ on a pristine, low miles BMW dealer-offered 2006 BMW 530xi with NO turbos and NO direct injection. I LOVE it. Nowhere near as fast but has that classic old perfect balance of handling, comfort, size and a slew of options my other car didn’t have, all for $10K!!!

RFTs give a much harder ride, cost about twice as much as conventional tires and may not be able to be fixed if you have a flat. The result of that will be a replacement tire costing $300 <U+0096> $350!

The engine lives up to its reputation and then some.  Amazing low end torque - really does feel like a V8.  This makes the 335xi a very different animal from the traditional BMW inline-6 car, and while quicker, it feels somewhat less sporting.  With the old inline-6s (and presumably the new 328) you really had to spool up the engine.  Now, you don't have to push it and if you do you're soon over the speed limit.  Great fit and finish.

My 2008 328xi Wagon came with 98K miles, but was in beautiful condition. I've driven it for a year and haven't had to touch it other than an oil change and to mount winter wheels, which I did myself. If you have a German car, stay away from the dealer except for specialized work and find a good independent shop that knows German cars. Basic maintenance like brake pads, rotors, filters and other normal stuff is pretty easy to DIY, so I'm not interested in paying labor rates for that. My 328xi Wagon and my wife's 09 328ix Coupe drive pretty much identically. I've never driven a wagon that handled so much like a coupe; it makes my eyes light up when I find a twisty road! The handling is excellent and great fun, but if you stay with the factory run-flat tires the ride will be a bit harsh. The seats are firm, but somehow they're still comfortable after 8 hours of driving. BMW has that exactly right, and the 3-series is fantastic on long trips! The instrumentation is too minimal (speedometer, tach, gas and but fuel mileage) but it's not a problem for those who trust lights and don't want lots of gauges. The driving experience is why you buy a BMW. The turbos have higher maintenance costs and more issues, so I bought the normally aspirated 328, which is a very reliable engine.  I am also one of the fortunate few who have the six-speed manual transmission, which makes driving at least 2x more fun. The shifter is quick and smooth, and the pedals are well set up for heel-and-toe shifting. BMW clutches tend to last a very long time, and my car has the original clutch at 105K miles. Clutch replacements will be expensive since BMW uses an unusual dual-disc flywheel that's expensive. Gas mileage is great for a sport sedan/wagon (mid to high 20's) for highway cruising, and in-town mileage depends on how heavy your right foot is (mine is heavy) and how much stop-and-go driving you encounter.The wagon model has enough room for four people (five only in a pinch) and a reasonable amount of cargo.  If you're packing for a sports event and bringing a fold-up canopy, you'll have to drop the smaller side of the 60/40 back seat to give yourself room for it.

Read this one!","I wanted:  stick-shift, black n'black, all-wheel drive, sharp-looking car.  When you consider the options and the prices, the higher-mileage BMW was definitely the right combination of features for the right price...admittedly with quiet risks attached..?  I read reviews, watched youtube videos, and kept my ears alert for advice from people with first-hand experience.  I bought the car with about 95,000 miles from a rather 'out-of-the-way' (we'll call it) car lot.  The combination of transmission, color, AWD, and year was very difficult to find - I would come back from test drives and someone else would be waiting.  I ended up getting the car a state away (Ohio).  I *assumed* I'd have to deal with the previous owner(s) not doing routine maintenance - and I assumed correctly.  Before I get into what all happened and how I handled it, a short bit about me:  electrical engineer with a life (so far) fixing my own cars.  First issue was the radio.  Decided on its own when to turn on or off...at first I thought the car was telling it to turn on and off, but after a far-to-lengthy analysis, I just replaced the radio (eBay, $300)...it has been fine ever since.  A few months later, the car began one day to run as if the engine was missing a cylinder.  I changed the spark plugs and all was well.  Again a month or so later...changed all the coil packs.  All good ever since (year+) (routine maintenance! did it myself; parts were about $200).  Sometime between the plugs/coils and the next repair I'll talk about shortly was the passenger-side rear tail light - a row of LEDs went out.  This caused the car to limit energy to the entire tail light, which made it look dim.  $60 and two bolts and that was OK (apparently there may have been a recall; didn't bother). Also replaced the battery.  It simply wouldn't hold a charge; $180 (big battery, did that myself too, routine maintenance!). Up until this point, I had no issues.  The car is a joy to drive and those repairs weren't a huge deal to me, maybe because I am handy.  The two profoundly irritating repairs were the blower motor for the heat/AC and the coolant pump.  On one of the coldest days this winter (so far), I was out of town (Chicago) for a wedding.  On my way home to Pittsburgh, the blower decided that it just didn't feel like turning on.  It was something like 15-20*F.  Fortunately, turning the air control to 'outside air' allowed the highway driving to keep me warm.  When I got home, I pulled the blower motor out myself (a known issue, since then a recall has been issued), lubricated the motor shaft, and reinstalled it.  All good so far.  Once you get the hang of it, its not too bad of a job...maybe 1/2 hour if you have a new blower on-hand.  Finally - the big one...the (electric) coolant pump.  As an engineer, I understand the concept, but I think I would've kept a crucial engine component like this mechanical to prevent what happened...it died.  On my birthday (4th of July), it proceeded to overheat (on one of the hottest days last year).  This repair was something I was willing to do, however, the car was too low to the ground for me to efficiently do it (would've needed a lift). I broke down and spent the $1,000 and all was well...for a minute.  Every once in awhile, the car informs me of a low coolant level...I assume a small leak somewhere (these cars have crap coolant systems, known fact)...so I will look into it when it isn't winter anymore.  At the moment, it's fine.  So - would I buy another one? YES.  Shifts like a dream, rides like a dream, the AWD is fantastic in wet/snowy conditions.  Gas mileage is OK (around 20mpg mixed conditions; I drive more aggressively, probably due to the stick-shift).  For some reason, when pumping gas, the fuel pump clicks off before it's full.  After a half tank, it takes a little while giving it fuel between clicks of the pump.  Slightly annoying, but not the end of the world.   Seat heaters are awesome in the winter.  Engine is a fantastic mechanical masterpiece...so balanced it sounds like a sports bike revving-up.  The controls and gauges are the usual beautiful red - easy on the eyes at night, everything is in a logical place and generally intuitive.  The cup holders are irritating if your cup doesn't have a lid (and sometimes even if your drink is full and does have a lid), but whatever.  Overall, if you do what you should do to a car and you diagnose problems properly and fix the easy ones, it hasn't been a bad car at all.  It's a joy to drive, and I love that it's the one I walk up to in the parking lot...the thing is gorgeous...keep up the maintenance and have a little money aside when that coolant pump/blower motor goes bad.  All-and-all I gave it a 4/5 across the board...dings for the radio, coolant pump, and blower motor.  I can't comment on dealerships because I haven't gone to any (the hours are not conducive to my 9-5).

The options and interior beat out many of the newer cars available today ( adaptive xenon, leather interior, wood trim, fine stitching, interior  lighting, hill descent control). The ride is very good and typical on highways of the best luxury cars, the ride on rough terrain or around town is painful given the suspension. I enjoyed driving this car; in the rain and adverse conditions this car offered incredible and confident road handling, great visibility and solid performance. Braking and handling are classic and sharp; heated seats and steering wheel are better than on any car I've owned or tested.  The trunk was deep given the lack of spare and provided ample storage for a coupe. Passing was always a breeze. Now for the negative... the 0-60 specs are around 7+ seconds which are pathetic for any car, the maintenance is painful, a 3 series is an entry level luxury car and I was shocked at the cost to maintain , every time i took it to the shop after 70k miles it needed something. The windows always fogged in cold and/or rainy weather and keeping the defroster on always made the cabin way too hot. It was impossible to keep a good temperature (notable BMW problem). The speedometer was always 5-10MPH faster than i was actually going (another notable bimmer problem-they purposely inflate to make it seem faster). After owning for a few years the depreciation in the vehicle was awful, everyone talks about the value of BMW but they don't hold it. All in all it is a great car with high quality assets but a fair amount of ""manageable"" downfalls. Bottom line is : you will enjoy the car and it is a better option over many newer vehicles however it will cost you to maintain and watch those potholes.",4,2009," BMW 3 Series Coupe 328i xDrive 2dr Coupe AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6M)"

This is one of the best cars I have ever had, out of about 10.  I have a 335 with sports package, premium package and 20 inch wheels.  Jet black with dealer installed blueing of the chrome, and window tinting.   It is a fairly sharp looking car. On a good road, it handles and accelerates really well.  It is great for a driving trip with good roads.  The premium stereo is best sounding I have owned.  Even after 6 years the interior still smells like a new leather wallet (analogy upcoming).  Get this car on a well paved road, switch to sport mode and let it rip.  It is a very happy experience.  However, it is likely to cost you.  After i settle down from paying the bills I can joke about it.  But I think there is a computer chip somewhere inside the makes things start to fail after the service contract ends.  For example, on the first service visit after the contract ended, they advised spark plugs and wheel alignment.  That was $1600.  (of course this includes the World-class check up). After a big rainstorm the computer thought the engine was overheating and made the car slow down on the freeway to 25 MPH.  That was fun.  Be prepared for unsympathetic people when you drive a BMW.  After 3 service visits they figured out it was water leaking into the battery compartment and cabling conduit. That was $3400.  Tires?   $1700, every two years.  Gotta love them run-flats.  I figure the car smells like a wallet to remind you of how much money you will need to continue to put into it. Even with that, I really like this car.  I sort of expected it was going to cost a lot once the warranty was up.  But not quite that much. I think that If I do this again, I would lease and make sure the lease ends before the warranty does.  But then it would be hard to get the extras just right.  That is, the sports package really does ride better than the standard suspension (I really did try both) and the premium stereo is really good sounding (I did try both).",4,2009," BMW 3 Series Coupe 335i 2dr Coupe (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M)"

Not impressed with the leaky radiator, it was a small leak but decided to replace it in order to avoid future issues. I originally planned to keep this vehicle for 2 or 3 years depending on experience. I think I will keep this vehicle for longer as it has held up pretty good. Still looks awesome and I plan to rather buy an SUV for my wife and start driving this car as a daily driver.",5,2011," BMW 3 Series Sedan 328i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6M)"

This is my 7th three series. M package, rear wheel drive manual 6speed, Power Kit so 320 HP.Noticed and felt engine noise since 68k miles. thought it might be the flywheel and clutch. Replaced at $3,000. Not the issueDealership did a compression test, said it needs a new engine. $18,000! BMW will cover 50% because it's out of warranty. I provided all oil change docs. BMW wanted to see oil changes at least every 15k. I averaged every 7,500 miles. Never auto crossed or tracked. Commuter car, 42 year old father of four. Not laying down patches or beating on the car.My take, don't buy a turbo model. Too much stress on the engine components. Never own one of these out of warranty, you're asking for trouble. Fuel pump was replaced under warranty (common issue), water pump was on  my dime. Hardly reliable, worst car I've ever owned. Beast on the highway? at 4.3 0-60 yes. Sad to say it, I'm a Bimmer guy through and through but that's it for me. BMW corporate said they wouldn't make a repair coverage decision until they knew for sure what the problem was. I wanted the dealership to drop the oil pan to definitively diagnose the issue  so I could tell BMW NA what was wrong. After the compression test all of a sudden the dealership clammed up like it was a cover up? The dealership would not go any further. They told the manufacturer that it needed a new engine without ever dropping the oil pan and taking a peek. Didn't make sense. I still want to have an independent garage take a look so maybe I can get some video or pics and post them. Forget about BMW customer service. I got someone on the line outsourced from India. If you must buy a BMW again never own one out of warranty! Unless your buying a fixer upper for a couple of grand. I traded it in on a new Silverado burying the negative equity of the Bimmer into the truck payment. Tough pill to swollow Good luck!",1,2011," BMW 3 Series Sedan 335i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M)"

I have a 335i xdrive with sports package that includes sports bucket seats, steptronic shifting paddles on the steering wheel, thicker steering wheel, tightened suspension. Other features are garage door opener, shadowline, sunroof, drop down rear seats, xenon head lights.First impressions from styling is always up to to driver but I feel the clean look has a mature look to it. It has the a classy look with a monster of an engine that you would never know by the look. Interior the car has clean lines with quality materials. The wood accent is nice. The feel of the dash is good and gives of no glare which is great for driving. The layout of the cluster does take a little to get use to. The radio is sometimes confused for  the heat and Ac. The directionals get a little to get use to as well as the cruise. Radio is good quality not great but the interaction with my cell phone works well. Comfort is bar none to any other. The sports seat hug you, in turns and are very comfortable on long drives. Like every car today you get a hundred different positions you can choose. The sports steering wheel is fat and so easy to hold. When sitting in the drivers seat you feel very comfortable. Rear seats are ample for two adults, tight with three. I run with two car seats and plenty of room. The trunk is deceivingly large but I suggest the pull down rear seats for runs to the hardware store. Very happy with the space in such a tight sports sedan.Engine and handling, there's a reason they say it's the ultimate driving experience. The inline six is smooth and powerful. It's smooth with the six gear transmission when you are driving other and want to take it easy. If you want to get on it, it has enough power to scare you and break a few laws. When in sports mode the gears are held a little longer and you can control shifting with the paddle shifters. I seldomly use the shifters while in sports mode but while on the highway in regular mode I will shift down to pass or change lanes. Once you get off the gas the car automatically shifts back into a higher gear. As far as handling the car is smooth on highways a little bumpy in the city due to the tightened suspension but if you get it into the mountains it is solid at high speeds around the corners. At times you'll surprise yourself how fast you take the corners with while feeling in total control.Reliability is a crap shoot, I've heard horror stories but the service by BMW is excellent. I drive an hour to Austin just to use them because they are worth the drive. Luckily I've had nothing but a few misfires. The car is 5 years old and turns heads were ever I go. It's tight, fast and comfortable. Every time I get into my car I smile and every time I get out I smile. My past cars have been Jeep Wrangler, VW golf, Nissan 300z, Hyndai Santa Fe, Infiniti FX35, Infiniti G35, BMW 328i and Acura MDX this is by far the best car I've ever owned maybe the best I've driven next to a Porsche 911. It's also 60k less than the Porsche and can fit my girls in the back. My wife feels like the car is too powerful and she doesn't feel comfortable driving it. She prefers the 328i which is more tame and is peppy if you want it.

The front rotors are warped and need replacing. When I floor it, sometimes it goes on limp mode; a self preservation measure which usually goes away when I restart the car.

The premium sound system is amazing, specially when playing from the hard drive. The HD radio is annoying as it bounces in and out of it. I'm probably going to keep it for another year and see how it holds up by then.The 3 series is a ""buyers car"". BMW sells so many of them that they flood the used car market at a fraction of their original MSRP. I found an excellent conditioned M Sport package still under CPO warranty for 2 more years and/or 40k miles for less than half of it's original MSRP, had 59k miles on the odometer but otherwise a near perfect car.In addition to the M Sport package, it also has the convenience and premium packages, so it is almost top of the line.",5,2011," BMW 3 Series Sedan 328i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6M)"

Unfortunately, every time the SES light comes on you can expect to pay around $1,000-$2,000 in repairs.

I lease the car as a daily driver, and drive a 2008 Corvette Z06 for fun.  I wanted a stick so I wouldn't get bored, and I wanted the four because the sixes feel heavy and not particularly sporty.  Even the previous-gen used M3s I drove felt lacking:  all muscle and no soul.  This is my fourth BMW in the last six years, and while each has had its strong points, they don't feel like the Bimmers I test-drove back in the '90s.  They're heavier, as are virtually all cars these days, and they've tilted so much toward refinement that they feel almost like a Benz.  But in its quest for refinement, BMW doesn't seem to have put much effort into the clutch and shifter.  The clutch can be abrupt.  When new, the shifter was rubbery and would frequently hang up.  Now that it's worn in a bit, it's smoother but still hangs occasionally, and it feels almost as clunky and Mattel-like as the shifter in the '89 Olds Cutlass International I owned years ago.  Given the customer take rate for sticks of one percent or so (Edmunds doesn't even offer a user review category for 3 series with stick) I can understand why BMW may not care much about clutch and shifter smoothness, but it's the last BMW stick I'll get, and probably the last BMW.  At least I've figured out how to drive the car:  like I stole it.  Drive it normally and you travel through (and occasionally dwell in) the Valley of Turbo Lag that's right off idle, lag you don't feel in an automatic because the torque converter masks the weak throttle response at very low RPM.  I had the same problem with a 2008 C300 with stick that I bought new--off the line the throttle feels like an on/off switch.  It's a fun sports sedan when put in sport mode and driven hard on a back road.  But drive it in traffic and it's actually more challenging to drive smoothly than my Z06--more challenging even than the STI I test-drove, a car not known for its smoothness.  And the STI felt far sportier.  BMW still does fine engineering, but in my experience it focuses these days on the mainstream customer, not the enthusiast looking for a nimble sports sedan.",4,2017," BMW 3 Series Sedan 330i SULEV 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

My goal was to replace my RX-8 R3, mainly because I want to have my family of 5 all fit in the fun car, and the RX-8's constant need to downshift was not fun anymore after 5 trouble-free years. Therefore I quickly ruled out the Cayman, GT350, as well as then ATS-V sedan (kids still need boosters, and most have a very wide bottom).  I drove the S6 first. It's such a quick car, the dual clutch was fast and smooth, and the interior was such a nice place to be! However, it is realistically a $78k car with some options, and it did not feel like a $78k car. Then the GS350 FSport -- it drove like a slightly updated version of my 2009 G37 -- little more numb, cool new gadgets to play with, same acceleration, ridiculously difficult to use ""mouse"" controller. It wasn't even that quiet cruising on the highway, which was supposed to be THE highlight of a Lexus. Then I thought I'd go for the M3, but happened to see a 340i xDrive at the same dealer, with a STICK! It was $64k sticker, with red leather, M Sport Trim, bunch of driver aides and tech stuff. Edmunds' own long-term 340i seemed to garner mostly positive reviews, so I was excited and tested it.  I won't bore you with all the details of the purchase experience, but they knocked $9k off (nobody knows how to drive stick anymore?), decent deal on the RX-8, and made me wait over an hour to ""prep and detail"" the car.  The biggest impressions so far, after about 500 miles: 1. The M Sport steering wheel is VERY nice, looks great (I stare at it far more than the exterior of the car, so exterior styling ranks very low in my book) and feels nice in the hands. 2. The clutch uptake is lazy (I am coming out of an RX-8, so this may not be fair to the BMW, but I hate it). 3. The gearing is wayyy too tall (performance of the manual tested elswhere is quite a bit slower than Edmund's long-term 340i auto), so despite the mountains of low-end torque, it doesn't give you that ""kick"" on takeoff. 4. The suspension is MAGICAL -- it stays relatively flat in corners but still soaks up bumps well. In contrast, the G37's suspension is firm enough to make the ride uncomfortably busy on New England roads, but does not keep it as flat while cornering. The GS350 is slightly better. Only the S6 is similar. 5. Getting on the gas out of a corner is so much fun, and the AWD system inspires a lot of confidence! 6. The steering is the same for the 340 as the S6 as the GS350. They are all pretty accurate, all very numb, and the ""sport"" setting just add effort without making it any more accurate or giving it any feedback. I agree with another reviewer here about the huge difference in handling compared to previous generations of BMWs -- I drove a 2009 328 xDrive when it was new (first time driving a BMW), and immediately was knocked over by the handling! I realized what all the fuss was about! 7. Nobody ever compliments the 3 series for how quiet it is inside.   In then end, I went for the 340i because it felt like it was at least 80% as capable as the S6, had the same bland handling, had a manual that wasn't available with the S6, so it was a much better value. Again, the ATS-V was out of the question because the back seats are too small for 3 kids with boosters; the Giulia consistently showed major quality issues that will ruin your driving experience (MT had an article about stranding in the middle of an intersection!!!); every other 5-seater had the same boring steering; so, I never thought I'd say this, but the BMW was a great value!",3,2017," BMW 3 Series Sedan 340i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

Sadly, I should have remembered a life preserver.Month 1 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 2 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 3 - 2 days out of service - hybrid battery/cold weather use warning.So, 2.2 months, over a month out of service total. Great start to my ownership experience.However, it gets worse. We have had very cold temperatures over the last two weeks, even for where I live in Richmond, VA. Days and nights well below freezing. I get that batteries don’t retain full charge in cold weather, but this one was only charging about 80% max and depleted even that very quickly...that is...when it actually allowed for electric operation. You see, what they don’t tell you is that the fully battery operation is not available in lower temperatures! Yep, that’s right. So, for all you who, like me, thought you could pretty much commute via full battery, well....guess what, ya can’t when it is cold out! Sad part is, this is considered normal according to my dealership. What burns my ass up even more is that a warning light stays lit on your dash and on your Nav screen to remind you that you paid $$$$ for a system you can’t use.Other things they don’t tell you - - -This is a 320e at best. You are going to deplete your battery relatively quickly (14 miles max in full electric mode) and once depleted, guess what? You aren’t running on 248 advertised horsepower, you are running on 180....with several hundred pounds on top of a similar 320i model! Battery regeneration isn’t enough for spirited driving or even multiple full throttle launches back to back! So, BMW has pulled the wool over my eyes, just don’t let it do the same to you.Other things I have found out by myself - - -$575 for side window sun shades? WTH? They are MANUAL!$2650 for Blind Spot/Lane Departure/and Frontal Impact Warning and a front/rear parking camera/sensor system with around view camera? Have they lost their MINDS?!? Worse yet, all you are paying for is warning lights and a shake of the steering wheel! Ridiculous and a waste of money unless you live urban and park on the street.So, as of this writing BMW USA has contacted me because they know that the cold driving issues (no full electric power) are an issue along with the horsepower claims.

This is the best car we've ever had. We've been driving our 2017 330i x-drive wagon, with M-Sport package and (importantly) adaptive suspension, for about 13,000 miles.  (Note that the 2017 and '18 models are almost identical.) It's a sheer pleasure.  First, the wagon looks gorgeous and is very distinctive -- almost unique --with its Estoril Blue color and Coral Red interior. The 250 hp G-48 engine purrs along with a pleasant sound is very fast and, combined with the 8-speed auto transmission, is consistent over the whole range of speeds.  At 90 mph the car is smooth and rock-steady. The ride is a nice balance between comfortable and firm. The safety tech and version 5.0 infotainment features are state-of-the-art. What really brings it all together from a handling and comfort standpoint is the adaptive suspension, which is a no-brainer at $1000. You won't find another compact wagon nearly this good, and virtually no cross-overs and SUVs -- including BMW;s -- compare with the looks and handling. It's a terrific road trip car as when we toured Nova Scotia.  It is rock-solid, comfortable, agile and ""planted"" with the X-Drive. Also, it's quite rare or even unique in our configuration. You will see very few 330i wagons on the road and almost none in the more rakish-looking M-Sport package.  Why get a BMW crossover that looks like every other crossover on the highway? Remember that every inch of added height in an SUV or cross-over diminishes handling.

I found it with 35K miles on the clock, and it was just about perfect:  Sport Line, Premium Package, Navigation, and 6 speed manual, Glacier Silver outside, Black Leather with Red Accents inside.   As the Germans would say, ""Schoen"".   Then there is the drive:  surprising power and quickness and the wonderful 50/50 weight balance that make the car so fun to drive. At the same time, you can comfortably and serenely commute or ferry passengers in it.  Plus, good fuel economy; in very mixed driving, I consistently get 25-26mpg, and that is with the car in Sport Mode 95% of the time.   So, yes, I really love my BMW; however, my love is not blind.  Among the things not so good are the halogen headlights.  Almost unsafely dim with the stock bulbs, so I upgraded to the brightest bulbs I could find.  Additionally, the base Hi-Fi audio system is not so great.  It lacks midrange, and Sirius in particular can sound muddy.  For reliability, besides a couple of warranty repairs (bad fuel injector, then fouled catalytic converter), my car has been relatively trouble free.  Being a BMW, yes, service and parts will cost you more.  I am going on the mantra of keeping up with the maintenance so as to avoid big issues.

They were WRONG!","Well, first things first, I pretty much had a good idea what I was getting involved in when I decided on a BMW. I've worked on a few different models in the past, including an engine rebuild and cooling system replacement. I've heard all the horror stories, and read most of these very reviews on Edmunds. There were some doubts placed in my mind for certain! But I ultimately decided to take a small leap.I managed to find a gently used metallic bronze CPO '13 328i XDrive in immaculate shape from a dealer that gave me more for my Crosstrek than anyone else in the area. So far, the car has been perfect; not one single issue. Except for one small scuff on the soft leather seat...my fault but covered under warranty. Runs great, great mileage, unbelievable handling, fast enough, attention getter...to me it just seems like a good daily driver. Though it is under warranty and I went ahead and purchased the extended warranty, I've already acquired all the tools and knowledge I need to repair nearly everything. I only wish it had a manual transmission. Not a deal breaker, though.The insurance cost surprisingly is what drove me to this car (pun intended). 2016 Mustang 5.0? 600 bucks more a year. 2016 Subaru WRX? 615 bucks more a year. 2013 328i? 12 bucks more a month than my friggin Crosstrek! I'm only angry I didn't buy a BMW sooner.Fuel mileage has been stellar. I had to drive from Virginia to New Jersey, about 300 miles or so, for work. Averaged 35mpg's and over 75mph.In my opinion, if you are the kind of person who can work on their own vehicles, the maintenance costs aren't much more than a Subaru or Toyota. If you're the kind of person that expects a car to go 100k miles with nothing but oil changes...better stick with Toyota.Performance? Coming from a Crosstrek, it feels like a rocket. Feels just a bit slower than my old Mustang, but MUCH more composed and smooth in the corners. Need more speed? 335i or M.Comfort? The seats are fantastic! I drove the Crosstrek to Miami from Virginia...once. I was in a lot of pain. Driving the BMW? I was ready to party in South Beach when I arrived.I will say I personally don't trust a 10k mike interval between services, so I change my oil in between.

This occurred during the warranty period and was taking care of.* 51,700 miles:  Turbo actuator fails.  Costs me $750 at the dealer since I was out of warranty.  I called corporate seeking assistance.

"2288",2015-10-28,"Left Coast Ken","2013 BMW 3 Series Sedan 335i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M)","Great Car for the ""Mature"" Hot Rodder!","Personal Background: Former USMC pilot who's always been a ""motor head"" at heart.  Previously owned numerous motorcycles (including 6-cylinder KZ1300) and performance cars (including Porsche 914/6 - a near perfect car for its day).  Now older, expected to act more mature & ""within my current station in life"" (though I don't want to) as a stalwart, semi-conservative, church-going member of my community .  This car is a perfect fit for that scenario - looks appropriate for someone in a suit & tie, but can still tear it up when you want!POSITIVES:My car is an early production model for 2013, having been built in South African & bought by me in April.  It has the seven speed automatic transmission - not the manual.  I refer to my 335i as a ""stealth"" street racer (with a luxury interior).  With the lower curb weight and same turbo 3.0 liter six-cylinder (N55) engine, it out-performs the larger 535i and a few others of the 6- & 7- series cars.  Considering that 95% of my driving is done with myself, or self & wife (5'4"", 105 lbs), the car is plenty roomy.  I've even had four full-sized adults in it for a 200 mile (3 hour) trip and no one made comments about lack of space.  Actually gets better mileage when on the Interstate running at about 80 MPH (West Texas & Utah), than down in the lower speed limits (65-70 MPH).  Goes where you point it & stays there!  The three different driving modes (Sport/Comfort/Economy) are great.  Most driving in Comfort range, but when I want some fun I put it in Sport mode - where it can be a terror (but fun to drive)!  CAUTION: Do not ""stomp"" on the accelerator (in either Comfort or Sport) unless you have both hands on the steering, wheel!  It will literally throw you back into your seat when you do (first time I did it I wasn't paying attention, had only one had on the wheel & was entering a transition curve from one freeway to another - I almost lost it).  It really is ""The Ultimate Driving"" machine in that I've taken it round trip from San Diego to the East Coast three times (average of 6000 miles in three weeks, or less) in the almost three years I've had it.  That doesn't even begin to count the number of times I've taken it from San Diego up to San Francisco (550 miles one-way) & back on weekends.  In each case I was able to make the drive with very little fatigue at the end of each day's driving.  The most distance I've covered in a single day in the 335i has been 1100 miles (one day of driving on one of the previously mentioned coast-to-coast trips).NEGATIVES: It took my dealership multiple tries to get my alignment correct in that I was always wearing the front tires on the outside edges (Yes, I keep all tire pressures per manufacturer's specs) and on the inside edge of the rear tires.  I had to work to get 40K miles on a set of tires (not cheap at about $1200 every time a new set goes on - for the least expensive brand/model tire recommended for the 335i).  I finally made adjustments to my tire pressures (increased the front & reduced the rear) resulting in the tires wearing (slightly) longer & much more evenly - with no apparent degradation of handling/performance!  My headlights always look like their aimed too low, unless on high beam, but I've been told (numerous times) they're set correctly.  I'm still not excited about the automatic shift lever where you have to pull it back toward you when you want to go ""forward"" (out of park/neutral) and push it forward when you want to go into ""reverse,"" but am now used to that (in fact I know that is the historical European throttle setup in aircraft, so guess it makes sense to the Germans).  Other than tires, I've only had to replace a faulty brake sensor switch (after over 2 years & about 75,000 miles).  Still pads left on all brakes at over 125K miles (maybe I'm easy on brakes).  Right rear tail light lens had to be adjusted within about 18 months (kept coming loose), but easy fix on that (covered by warranty).OVERALL:Car has been rock solid and one heck of a bunch of fun to drive!  Get one if you get the chance (a bunch should be coming up for sale after finishing their 3-year lease with original drivers).  When I purchased my 335i my expectation is that it would last for at least 8 years and go for 250,000 miles and it looks like it will easily make that (I also have a 2003 Ford F-150 that is now 15 years old & has over 435,000 miles on it), since we're now at 5 years and I have over 125K on it.  My wife is using it for her daily driver in a major Calif metro area and loves it for that.  I take it out on the weekends and drive all the country roads in the area (of which there are plenty) since I'm now retired and do not put the miles on it I used to!  We still take it on the occasional long weekend ""out & back"" & it runs like a champ!",5,2013," BMW 3 Series Sedan 335i 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6M)"

First let me say that I was sold on this car before the salesman pulled over to let me drive it purely  based on how comfortable the upgraded seats were and how powerful it felt on the road. Quiet, powerful, and a very smooth acceleration. The 5.0 or M version is tempting, but really not necessary for me because this car gets out of its own way quickly. It seats five with ease, and unless you are over 6'5"" the back seat is perfectly fine, and I have not had any problems filling up the rear with a ton of groceries. I own the M sport, loaded with options that are actually very easy to use and I usually do. The navigation screen is huge and clear.  I like the sloping roof line and M sport molding much better than the X5 or any other similarly shaped SUV. Recently took a road trip (1800 miles) and it was extremely comfortable.

Loved the roadsters but needed something more practical yet sporty.  The 2016 X6 was the ticket.  We looked closely at the X4 but it was an odd size and would no meet our needs.  The X6 has plenty of headroom, front and rear seats.  It rides exceptionally well and is incredibly smooth.

"2324",2016-01-19,"Str8line","2016 BMW X6 SUV xDrive35i 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)","You have to live with it to really know...","I'm a wagon guy. A utility guy. A lover of great handling, powerful cars. I spend my money on cars. To me the ultimate car for the money is a GTI, or maybe a truck if you want the ultimate in utility. But let's say you can afford to splurge on a luxury car... why would you get an X6? Well, first off I have a truck. And a sports car(911). And a wagon(BMW 530). But the wagon is getting older and it was time for a replacement. So naturally I got the X6M as the ultimate wagon. That was a little over a year ago and when it was time to get rid of my wife's third row SUV(Mercedes GL550) for something smaller she decided on... another X6! This time the six cylinder X35i. I was surprised. But this is a surprising vehicle. Don't believe what they say about its storage space, there is a ton, trust me. Like fill up two shopping carts at Costco and fold down the rear seats and watch the X6 swallow it all, space. Which brings me to the X5's cargo space. This is the same car as the X5, just without the tall rear, so in the x5 you really only gain the space above the cargo area where you would stack stuff, and then you can't see out the back window. If you have one vehicle that extra space in the x5 might be important, but if you have a truck or don't usually buy big items you won't miss it. As I said the X6 has a LOT of space in its own right. Also, don't believe what they say about the rear seat room. I'm 6ft. tall and there is three inches of room above my head, and a large amount of legroom. The back seat is actually much more comfortable than the X5's which feels a little like a bench. Now for the good stuff... The X6 is an incredibly fun vehicle to drive. I have a 911. I have an X6M. I know fun. The 35i is a potent engine with great throttle response and a sublime transmission. The suspension is firm, never harsh and entices you to drive this thing like a race car. The brakes are stout. The steering is not 911 or X6M great but it's pretty good and the really the only thing drive-wise they could improve in my opinion. The steering is too light but if you're not jumping out of a 911 or X6M or GTI or BRZ you might not realize that it's not perfect. Want to go off-road? I drove an X3 through the off-road course at the BMW plant in South Carolina and trust me you can do a lot with the x-series BMW's. I go to Moab. I drive Jeeps on their gnarly routes. The X6 won't do that but don't underestimate its abilities off-road, it is very impressive. And the interior, oh my the interior. Wow, wow, wow. Gorgeous. Quality. Comfort. Perfection. The exterior? Well I like it. I don't love it like the 911 exterior, or a Ferrari. But it is different and there is something about this car that makes you take notice. I think it's cool, if a bit quirky. As I said, you really have to live with this vehicle to realize how great it is. One pleasant surprise has been our MPG with the X6. We are averaging over 20MPG in mixed driving with lots of hills. Our old diesel Mercedes GL averaged 20 and we thought that was great. 20MPG for this sporty, gas vehicle is super impressive and I have heard of people getting over 30 MPG on the highway.

If you’re thinking about buying one you better buy a fire extinguisher and a few cases of oil.  I bought a Vermelain Red Black interior 2012.  Loved the car at the time.  Paid big bucks, everything at BMW is a “package”.  I like to keep my cars – not this one.  I had it about a month and it had a chassis malfunction. No one could figure out what that was and the problem came and went.  Then there was an indicator for “increased battery discharge”.  The dealer changed cables etc., I brought it in about 4 times then demanded a new battery which I got.  Then the indicator said “high battery drain”.  Fed up at this point I waited until the car had to go in for the next service.  When I brought it in they wouldn’t release the car back.  The keyless system was somehow communicating with the battery and the car was ready to go on fire.  Around the same time about 5,000 miles the car is asking for oil.  They said that’s all normal wait until it hits 15,000 miles.  15,000 miles came and went the car needed a quart of oil every 5000 miles.  The need for oil then started to increase as the mileage continued to increase.  Eventually, every 900 miles the car needed oil.  BMW insisted that was all normal.  I wrote to Germany (in German) they referred the problem to BMW North America.  They sent a service technician to look at the vehicle – said it was all normal.  I was the one topping off the oil not BMW.  Then they told me they wanted me to go to the dealer every time it needed oil.  Really! – I drive over a 100 miles a day.  The dealer is about 2 hours away round trip.  I would waste 2 hours every 2 weeks on oil!  Beyond that, BMW did nothing.  At approximately 50,000 miles it didn’t seem to have the drive or acceleration intensity that is used to have; it couldn’t get out of it’s own way.  The dealer said it was normal.  The next visit for service not long after the complaint of lack of acceleration – eureka it’s leaking oil and the turbos need rebuilding (which was another 6 weeks at the dealer).  That was fixed I drive into my driveway to see the “oil” light go on again – back to the dealer I go.  After all that the car did regain its acceleration that it should have.  Now 5 years later I am still putting a quart of oil in the car every 900 miles.  It needs brakes (normal maintenance), turbos either need to be rebuilt or replaced, and the I Drive is playing games.  You put it on one thing and it changes itself to another.  Using an independent mechanic certified in BMW who doesn’t charge like a dealer the cost of this vehicle to keep for 1 year has been $10,000.  After paying $90,000 for a vehicle you would expect a lot more from the car, the dealer and BMW – you get nothing from any of them.  Now do you want to do that – me either it’s traded never to be purchased again!",1,2012," BMW X6 SUV xDrive50i 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)"

The interior is well thought out and the controls are very easy to use. The 8 cyl engine gives incredible power! Love the side sun shades! 10 way adjustable seats are incredible. One thing to investigate if looking to purchase is oil consumption! Twin turbo seems to consume an unusual amount of oil! I've investigated issue through forums and BMW service. 1 quart per 2-3 thousand miles supposedly is within BMW guidelines. Some mechanics say this is crazy some say this is normal. The car monitors engine oil level with an easy to read picture. Topping off oil is very easy to do. I would not purchase this car without a warranty! Having owned several BMWs I would not want to reach into my pocket for even the simplest of repairs. Very good in the snow. Run flats have come down in price so tire purchase is acceptable.

As I usually get bored and trade every 2-3 years. When I saw the X-6 the lines were nice but the hatchback style was a turn off for me. Then they brought out a white pearl 2018 X-5 that was loaded and when I drove it felt better than I remembered  as to ride, quietness in the cabin, controls layout. Personally I have never had a problem w/BMW's control dial. Now you just speak and it does what you ask! The X-5 w/xdrive and the 465bhp twin turbo V-8 provide all the oomph you want from a dead stop. I went on YouTube and a regular X-5 V-8 w/the M options-same as mine was rocketing off from a dead stop faster than an X-6M class. I knew there was no way the X-5 w/the V-8 could out pace the X-6M and after about 6 failed attempts from the X-6M driver- the X-5 driver finally started them both off again and told the X-6M driver how to set his launch control. Then it was over. The 550 +bhp M class X-6 shot out front and the X-5 stayed close to about 80mph and then the X-6M opened up a huge gap. I do not need 550+bhp (would I like it? you betcha!) but I am not going to be challenging any M class BMW's as the X-5 is decked out w/all the options I wanted including the various M class upgrades but it is still a BMW X-5 Xdrive w/a twin turbo V-8 and that is just fine by me. The vehicle is glued to the road. Cornering is nearly like being in a high end sports car- as you can feel the the suspension taking the cornering in stride and adjusting accordingly. With the Xdrive you do not 'burn rubber'- you take off! Dodge Ram trucks w/the semi v-8 -Ford Raptor's are in your rearview before they knew what happened. The 2018 X-5 is not a racing or track SUV but it certainly sends you off and down the road quicker than you anticipated! The rear tires a sight to behold! The front of the X-5 is 76"" wide, the rear of the X-5 w/the twin turbo V-8 is 86"" wide! Those huge fat tires on the back end would provide one heck of a launch if you chose to do that as it does have launch control in the Sport ++ setting. I will not even think of trying that until I have 1,000 fairly pampered miles on it-the owner's manual says '200 miles and after you can do launch control' but it is a real wear activity for your vehicle and I would not recommend it more than a half dozen times a year-if you plan on keeping your vehicle past the 4 years of warranty. Very impressive and greatly improved from my 2007. All the various adjustments that come w/the M option include the 20 way adjustable seats so you can have the bolsters on the sides hug you and you feel firmly planted in your seat. And the looks of that metallic pearl white, the rumble of the factory exhaust, those beautiful rear tires-causes fellow drivers to really eyeball your vehicle. Sweet ride, excellent performance, outstanding sound system that I can hook my iPod up to; BMW made a superb SUV in the 2018 X-5 w/Xdrive to the point where you want to go the long way or find a reason to head to  anywhere as on the highway it is so quiet...no wind noise at 100mph and it just wants to cruise at 80+ mph!

But for two persons it is fine  Don't understand the lack of a heated steering wheel.  The good is the unique and attention getting style. All the technology and the electric mileage with the anxiety relieving Range extender.  The bad reliability.  Over $5k in warranty work in the first 25k miles.

"2396",2017-05-21,"Kurt","2014 BMW i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)","I am an i3 believer!","I was looking for a stylish EV that was fun to drive, reliable, and had looks I appreciated.  I had read numerous reviews on the i3, had seem them on the streets, and had more than once concluded it was not the car for me.  However, when we had arrived at the BMW dealership to test-drive a 2014 3-series diesel wagon (I was getting desperate), there was my car for sale, beckoning my wife and I.  Now, my wife knew my checklist, and after asking our questions and taking it for a test drive, she was convinced this was my car.  I had my reservations, as I commute around 30 miles to work, and am usually driving an additional 30-50 miles for business meetings each day.  Given that this car is rear-wheel drive with no AWD, I had concerns about the snow.  Additionally, the list price of the car was a lot higher than Edmunds' TMV and Cars.com's average recent sold price for these vehicles.  Lastly, the i Remote app for this car had just horrible reviews.  On the positive side, my car had just over 19k miles, includes the Giga and technology packages, was certified pre-owned, and in fantastic condition with no visible wear and tear.  After 2 months with it, having driven over 3k miles in snow, rain, freezing cold and 90+ degree heat, I was loving the car.  I drive very conservatively, making full use of the one-pedal driving (which had a quick learning curve) and never going above 68 mph on the highway.  I typically do a mix of highway with twisty backroads.  However, with all the mileage I drive, I hardly use the range extender.  Most of my meetings are in Boston, and I can usually find a garage with an available charging station.  When I have to fill up on gas (that sounds so odd to type), it was always a 2-second fill, staying under $3 per fill.  This car feels incredibly solid to drive - like you're in a tank, it just feels so heavy - yet it is very nimble.  The steering is precise and tight.  Handling on the curves is fun, but the car feels unstable if you really push it.  Surprisingly, without the snow tires, it handles pretty well on snow-covered roads - it even got me out of my uphill driveway without any slippage.  You just feel more connected to the road with the i3.  Being bottom-heavy and somewhat tall, it can easily be affected by strong winds on the highway.  Yes, this is an odd looking car.  In my opinion, it looks best from any profile view, and just plain odd from a direct front or back view.  The inside is beautifully designed, spacious, and posh.  For utility, the overall storage space is not much, but I am able to make my transfer station trips with a full-size plastic garbage can and several square container bins of recycling.  As for the i Remote app, it has had its share of bugs, but otherwise works like a charm (I even gave it a glowing review in the App Store).After driving 14k+ miles on this car, and now having owned it for going on 10 months through all New England seasons, do I still believe in the i3?  Yes, yes I do.  Since my first review of the vehicle here on Edmunds, I have had new revelations about it.  First and foremost, the car's battery does not like cold temperatures, and thus I am suffering from the obligatory 'range anxiety.'  I have seen a significant drop in mile range on a full battery charge.  Where I was averaging between 80 to 90 miles per full charge during the summer, I am now getting between 60 to 70 miles, if that.  My maximum distance driven on a full charge is exactly 100 miles, which I achieved during the summer with a mix of highway and city driving using A/C sporadically.  Currently, with these cold temperatures in the teens and 20s, it is difficult to get even 60 miles on a full charge.  I recently drove a 2017 BMW i3 with range extender in 25 to 35 degree temperatures (Fahrenheit), and observed that its battery is impervious to the cold, on top of its larger mile range.  Of course, now I desire a 2017 i3.  Secondly, my i3 handles fantastically in the snow with its Blizzak snow tires.  I have complete confidence in taking my car out into a snowstorm, having already tested it driving through snowy road conditions on the windy, hilly backroads of southern New Hampshire.  Thirdly, my i3's factory speaker system sounds loud and crisp using the radio, but when utilizing its USB or bluetooth capabilities with my iPhone, the auditory volume drops dramatically, thus forcing me to crank up the car's volume control.  Lastly, the sun visors are simply too small and are terrible at blocking out the sun through the windshield and door window.  In conclusion, I am quite happy with my car, despite its low range in the winter, and happy to have the range extender as a backup.  I have had no issues with it otherwise (i.e. nothing has needed repair).  My only other concern about it is its depreciation, and hope that the vehicle is not obsolete when it is time to trade it in.",4,2014," BMW i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)"

My hybrid was costing me $600/mo to own & operate (required maintenance but I knew I would never be stranded by a dead battery. I've been wanting an electric car for a few years now but the range of the EVs that I CAN AFFORD has been too low to take the risk of being stranded. So I discover the 2017 BMW i3...I only discovered the i3 a few months ago and upon reading the configuration of the i3 w/Range Extender, realized that it is perfect for the driving I do. It is always in EV mode and if I use up all of the juice, the generator comes on and keeps me going. BUT I couldn't justify the price tag of the new 2017...it would cost me more to own & operate the i3 over my Honda which would negate all financial benefits of going electric. SOOOO...I started searching for older i3s and found that the oldest ones are 2014. The cheapest one I found was listed at a used car lot 170 miles away. I bought it for $15,900 w/62,212 miles and it was a dealer buyback on the lemon law. I've owned it 6 weeks now and it's been a total dream car!

It is fun to drive, roomy, handles well, and is quite stylish. The range is ok as long as you have a second gas powered car for trips because you're not taking this one anywhere out of town. The range is ok but you learn to change your operating style to maintain the charged batteries where you feel comfortable, for me I don't let it go below about 30% even with the REX. For an urban car its great for anywhere else, I'd think twice. I have had my car for nearly 1/2 year and generally like the car...would I buy another one? Maybe. Here's the rub: The technology is good but not great, the BMW i app that goes with the car is unimpressive; the ratings on the app store are surprisingly bad. It only has a few features that matter and those are pretty predictable. I'm really unimpressed with the integration with smart phone, I expected a lot more on an electric car (see TESLA). One would think, BMW Engineering would do a better job with an app on an all electric car. As to reliability: first, I had software problems with the entertainment system, the XM radio suddenly went dead. The car spent almost 10 days in the dealership while they tried to figure it out finally replacing just about everything...not good. Secondly the tires, this is the second set of Bridgestone's I've had problems with on a BMW. My first were the Bridgestone run flats on a previous late model M3, on that car I replaced 8 tires in 2.5 years for simple punctures. So far the i3 seems on track to beat that record. In 6 months I've already replaced 2 tires for simple punctures. (i3 has no spare) and the i3 are not run flat so the problem gets a whole lot worse. One would have thought that with no spare and no run flat, BMW would have required a highly reliable tire from Bridgestone...they didn't.

The car was delivered factory perfect and has only had one recall and one software upgrade.  It delivers the same range as when it was new.What the car is: An incredibly fun, nimble, exhilarating, holy cow, I can't believe a car can be this fun to drive, I feel like I am 16, where can I go next car.  The drive train and ride are un-naturally smooth and quiet.  It's remarkable.  It's fun in a vintage English sports car way complete with very predicable 4 wheel drifts, blazing acceleration, wicked torque and grand prix ""one pedal"" driving.  The car effortlessly dives into turns with the regen breaking acting like a hand break to unlock the back wheels, only to instantly re-engage as you hit the accelerator (yes, that is what it is) to power out of the turns.  Anyone that drives this car as a hyper miler is missing one the best driving experiences imaginable.  The fun comes from a combination of super-car ratio of torque-to-weight and grossly inadequate tires.  The latter is so poor that you can have all this fun below 40mph instead of 80 in an M5 or Vette.  That's not a bad thing.What it is not - a highway car.  At speeds above 80 this car is a white knuckle death ride and will take every bit of your driving skills to keep control.  It's top speed is governed at 98 but it has a practical limit of about 75.  If you are a pre-dawn commuter accustomed to hitting triple digits with your fellow commuters, step away and find another car.  As example of how slow you need to drive this car, I historically have an avg driving speed of 44mph while in this car it's 33!.  I guess it could use some air dams to keep the air from floating the car  - maybe they could also help keep the car from getting airborne on mountain roads too.  Living electric - you have to want to.  This is an 90% car meaning it fills 90% of your car needs and am able to use it with some planning for almost everything except weekend trips with the family.   I use a level 1, 110v charger at home and it comfortably charges the car overnight (10K is about 25mile/day) on most days.  I only need to use public charges 2-3 times/month for the longer trips.  Using some ""extreme couponing"" type planning, I can string together 150 mile jaunts and have done 400miles in a weekend using only 1qt of gas.  It's possible because the range extending engine does its job to allow you to use the full batter capacity (I get about 80mile range in the summer and 60 mile in winter).  The REX however is in sharp contrast to the ultra refined electric drive in that it's  roughness, loudness and vibration is on par with your father's vintage tractor.  It works fine in city/suburban driving but the algorithms that control the battery reserves are not set for highway driving especially in the mountains.  A short hill quickly depletes the battery's reserve and you will find yourself seeking refuge from speeding cars behind a tandem trailer as you slow to 50mph to prevent an emergency shut-down.   Living with the car - The phone interface is incredibly disappointing and archaic.  The car rarely recognizes the phone when plugged in but still locks out most phone features (for obvious safety reasons) so you either have to do without or reinitiate the apps.   BMW's newest addition to the iDrive system is ""graffiti"" style input circa 1992 Palm Pilot.  The voice recognition is very poor and frustrating.  It could be due to a poor microphone or its placement.  There are however two redeeming features - you can bypass the car's labyrinth of commands and access Siri via a button on the steering wheel or use one of 8 programable buttons on the dash to get instant access to any car/phone function.  The sound system is a disappointment and certainly not on level with the car's price tag (I have the standard system).  Fortunately you don't spend a lot of time in this car but if you rely on your phone for music, navigation and calls, you will be disappointed.  I use it as an excuse to unplug connect to the kids and enjoy the drive.The car's navigation system is equally poor.  I used it only 3-4 times and stopped after it directed me the wrong way on a 1-way street.  On a separate occasion it dropped us in the middle of a cemetary instead of a soccer field.  The traffic feature side by side against Waze was inadequate and slow to offer alternate routes around traffic.

If I have to charge at home, I need to use some chargers down the street (which is fine because they're free!) I've had it over a month now and have yet to use the range extender.

If you are parked side to side with other vehicles and open the front door and coach door at the same time, you're sort of trapped in the triangle while trying to get things out of the back seat. The trunk is much smaller than my Honda Fit. It barely fit my large suitcase. But I knew all of these things before I purchased so I can't complain.

I test drove a BMW 5 series and was disappointed, I felt claustrophobic and just didn't seem right. So I decided to try the i3, boy was I surprised! It doesn't have the back seat room like my VW, but it's fun to drive, gets amazing fuel(kW) mileage, and seems to fit my life style just fine. I opted for the REx version and glad I did.

It is my wife's commuter and driving around town car and she absolutely loves it!  It fits her needs perfectly and she loves driving it.  We have solar panels, so we have not seen any effect on our electric bill.  I installed a 240V 6 gauge 4 wire electric line to the garage that is tied to the breaker box with a double-poled 50 amp breaker.  I then installed a Juicebox 40 Amp 240V Level 2 charger (car charges maximum capacity at 32 Amp so the oversize doesn't hurt as the car will only charge to its maximum capacity) and it can take the charge from depleted to full in about 3.5 hours.  If you install a 240 V charger, be sure to go into the car computer charging settings and change the 240 V charge level from ""minimum"" (which is the default) to ""maximum"" to fully utilize the capacity of your Level 2 charger.  If you are thinking of purchasing an electric car, buy a used one as they depreciate very quickly because of a weak resale market.  For our situation and intended use of this car, it fits us perfectly.  Hopefully it will be a reliable car for years to come.Update:  We have owned the i3 for 7 months now and still loving this vehicle.

I drive it around 90 miles a few times a week. The range extender has kicked in a couple of times and has taken away the range anxiety. Not having to go to the gas station once a week (sometimes more) is a great feeling. At first I was charging the car using the 110v charger and that was a frustrating experience. It would take anywhere from 17-19 hours. The BMW wall charging station is now installed and this has dramatically improved charging time to 3-3.5 hrs. I went from a X5 3.5i to this car and the car drives and brakes like a BMW with very slim tires. If the tire pressure is too low or too high the driving dynamics change quite a bit. Best to keep an eye on your tire pressure. It leans a bit more when making sharp turns, but nothing like a 80s Cadillac. I enjoy driving twisty back roads and love the instant power. It is addictive... Getting to speed is not a problem, cruising at 75 miles or higher you need to correct the steering a bit more than normal. It took a couple of days to adjust to driving with just the gas pedal. Regenerative brakes are quite aggressive and do assist with slowing the car down quite a bit and only rarely do I need to use the brake pedal. This is something I adjusted to with no issues. The front seats are very comfortable and have good support. Driving position is upright more like an SUV. The back seats are comfortable for passengers under 6 ft. Cargo space with backseats in their position is kind of small, but significantly improves when the rear seats are flattened.

We're impressed but there was no urgency in getting one(yet).  Meanwhile, we continued to monitor its progress and other brands' offerings.Last year(2015), as my two kids started multiple after-school activities which averaged 45 miles round-trips per day, the carbon footprint (and gasoline bills) started climbing.  We decided to look at EV again.  With attractive year-end incentives and government rebates, we went out and leased one.The whole family(especially the kids) is enjoying the new ride.  We feel less guilty about our carbon footprint with this vehicle.  For our use cases, it was the best option.  The rear seats are a bit small(compared to our sedan) but for local travel, it was not an issue.  The acceleration is good and we like the newer technology that came pretty much standard in this car.Update(after 2 years): Errata: the car was on lease, not bought.  The car continues to impress us.  However, with two teenagers still growing taller and taller, interior space is growing smaller.

I am not a tree hugger but I am a technology geek and the i3 has some fantastic technology built in.  My first impression of the i3 was that this is one ugly car and I did not like the look of the pizza cutter tires.  However, after driving it for several weeks, not only have the looks grown on me (as well as the 20 inch skinny tires), but i find it the car extremely enjoyable to drive.  In fact, it is so enjoyable that my wife prefers the drive to her Range Rover Sport and is constantly asking me to leave it at home so she can drive it.  The off-the-line acceleration is fantastic, which has helped alleviate the sorrow of losing my V12 gasoline engine.  The interior room for the front occupants is extremely roomy (I am 6'1"" with a large frame).  For a sub-compact car, this feels roomier than most other much larger cars.  The user interface took a while to learn, but now that I am familiar with it, I am very impressed.  The entertainment options are endless, especially when I connect my iPhone and use all of the music, streaming and pod cast services.  I use the car primarily to commute to work, 36 miles round trip.  I am also able to charge the car at work.  For commuting, the car is ideal.  I do have the range extender, but I have never actually used it as I have good charging options between work and home but it does take range anxiety out of the equation.  If I had to pick anything that I don't like, it is the placement of the electrical charging port, which is located on the back, passenger side of the car.  This requires me to get the charging cable and walk around to the other side.  While this is clearly a first-world problem, it would have been much easier to locate the charging port close to the driver's door.  The materials inside are excellent and I especially like the wood in the dash.  I leased the vehicle because I am not yet comfortable with the residual value of an EV, but given the subsidies available, and the fact that I no longer buy gasoline, this is a very economical vehicle to operate.    Overall, I was just looking for a very different car experience from buying another internal combustion car.  The experience so far is highly recommended.",4,2015," BMW i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)"
"2430",2015-08-28,"Bruce M.","2015 BMW i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)","i3 VS 2013 Chevy Volt","My volt lease was up and I couldn't extend to wait for the 16 volt.  So I wanted to stay electric and this was the only other choice with ""range extending"" capabilities.   So as a VERY happy Volt owner I was very worried about changing.  So here is the deal.  Had the car a week with a mix of city and freeway driving at speeds up to 75 mph.  BMW -the plusses:   way faster acceleration .  Way quieter ride. Better road feel and solid feeling.  Perfect regenerative braking. Much roomier cabin and comfort for tall folks ( Im 6'3). Better/Great turning radius.  Perfect higher but not to high seating/drivin position.  Easy In&Out.   Considerably better battery range - about 72 miles / compared to 38 miles.  Better regenerative battery charging in city driving.  Able to extend mileage better. Much better BMW 4 year full maintenance warranty.    Love the ""coast"" mode when you just ease off the gas just right.   One pedal driving!!  Love that!  Easier access to rear seats.  Better safety features ( adaptive cruise control with city stop start is awesome).  Have not seen this on another car.  Set it for 40 mph.  Brings you to a stop in traffic and stays engaged.  Then starts you up again when the light changes.  Pretty much auto pilot driving.  Auto magic Parallel parking mode.  (Have not tried this yet so can't say if it actually works well or not). Traffic nav system included with best energy routes based on traffic. Better solid German build quality compared to volt.  Switch gear , fit and finish.So whats not to like that the Volt does better?  Ride still to ""stiff"" and I have the 19"" wheels.  It's on the border of being the perfect balance.  The 20"" wheels have a lower profile tire so I am sure they would make the ride even more stiff which would not be good.  I don't know why so many car manufacturers keep making such stiff suspensions when most americans like a softer ride.  Cant you find the right balance?  Some cars do, but a lot don't.  (Rumor is the new 2016 volt will have a better ride quality than the current model).   Also not good in the BMW is the car is a bit ""skittery""  on broken pavement when taking a turn.  Especially the back can kick out.  This is because it is very light and the tires are very thin.  But the regular handling on decent roads feels good but the steering is very ""sensitive.  Especially at freeway speeds.  The slightest movement of the wheel really moves the car.  I may get used to this but for now I have a harder time keeping the car in a straight line.  Don't know if this is the thin tires or light weight or weight of the electric steering or a combination of all three but this is where the volt drives much better.  User customization of the many features of the car is lacking and much better in the Volt.  Range extender engine is much quieter in the BMW but has only a 1.9 gallon tank which will get you about 60 miles more if full.  Volt holds 8 gallons so gets you the range of a regular car.  So the BMW is really a city car with the bonus of if you need to make a ton of trips across town in one day, you can do it.   So if you are cool with just  a city car you should not have any concerns about the BMW.  Larger side mirrors on the volt are better.  New volt will have lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring.  BMW doesn't have that.  Kind of baffling as this is tech that many cheap american cars now have.  In particular blind spot monitoring is a very worthwhile feature in my opinion.  Oh forgot.  Volt radio , even the high end Bose upgrade is not that good. It's OK but The BMW with the upgraded Harmon radio is great in comparison.  Big beef.  Charging port on the BMW is on the passenger side REAR of the car!  So pretty much you need to back in to any parking space or your home if you want to charge.  The volt is just in front of the drivers door.  Perfect spot.  Not sure I understand the logic of the rear charging door.  But the BMW has a lighted charging port that changes colors.  cool.  Also BMW has super fast Tesla like DC charging built in at no extra cost.  Now if only you can find a DC charging station.  Someday. Some of the interior ""eco"" materials used on the BMW make it feel weird and cheap.  It is recycled material but it looks like crap.  I'm sure the germans can figure out a way to make recycled material look nice and have a soft finish which would make the car even quieter.  Cost.  Volt is 10,000 cheaper for the loaded model.  Thats a big difference.  The volt in three years has been almost 100% trouble free.  A very rare thing for a high tech car.  i give GM very high kudos for building such a high quality car that has not needed to be in the shop. Summary?  I'm liking the much quieter ride and super power acceleration and better comfort of the Beemer. The unique styling can be a turn off for some but I think it grows on most people.   Now lets see if it is as reliable and trouble free as the volt.  I hope so.   I'll report back after more driving.",5,2015," BMW i3 Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Range Extender (electric DD)"

Unbelievable a 50K car that is broke, takes this long to repair and requires the help of Germany to repair.Update since first post:Car has been in repair now 3 times, the latest as on June 2016, the check engine light is ON, Dealer says BMW Engineers are trying to find out why. The car is always broken. Funny thing, when I went to drop off my i3 for repairs, there were 2 i3's in front of me, one so bad they had to put it on a dolly to move it.Let me also point out a few of the down sides of owing this car:1. The rear doors opening in the suicide fashion are also not a very good design, especially in parking lots with other vehicles parked close by. For example, say you have a child, you need to open both the front door, then the rear. You are now trapped between two doors, you have to fight with one of the doors to keep closing then opening to get to the stroller to get your child. Also if you are shopping and need to put things in the rear seat, same thing. A REAL PAIN... Don't believe me, give it a try with cars parked on each side that hug the white stripe. Then you will wish you din't have this car.Next the rear storage is small at best, you can't fit a full size stroller in the rear. If you do have a stroller, then you have no place for groceries.Now on to the body of the car, it is really a collection of plastic parts snapped together, most are very flimsy at best, and if you really stand back and look at the car, there are at least 4 different colors on the car. Looks like an erector set gone bad. The fit is also not very good. The front gas cover is really a terrible design with the locking as the pin is at the bottom and can be easily opened. Just a waste on the lock. So many curves and design elements. A real pain to clean the outside with so many panels and shapes.Next, did I say the rear windows do not roll down. They don't and another let down.  The tires are very different and skinny, makes the car very un stable feeling when you hit a smooth bump in the road such as a railroad track crossing, you can feel the car slide. Also if it's wet outside, even worst! Please don't speed around any corners with these skinny tires. Overall, the car has many short comings and things you never think about until you have it. It was neat looking in the showroom. In the real world, this is one of the worst cars I have ever owned/leased. I can only say that my feelings around BMW is this, a HIGH PRICE for such a TERRIBLE BUILT CAR.

Wow, I finally picked-up our 2017 i3 REX specially ordered from BMW’s “I” plant in Germany (highly recommend designing and ordering your own, it’s fun and worth the wait).  We chose Fluid Black with Blue Accent exterior and it is beautiful (the only current USA solid color option for the i3).  I thought Fluid Black may blend in with all the other similar size/style cars but it is still very distinctive and like no other car on the road with thanks to BMW’s design and using accent colors like the electric blue.  However, I still miss the Black Sapphire Metallic paint quality.  We also selected the Deka World interior and it matches the exterior colors perfectly (really, it’s above our expectations and we are VERY picky!).  We also selected the 19 inch “428” style rims for the tires and they are awesome!  We couldn’t be happier with the color choices.  We waited to order our i3 so we could have the larger 94ah battery, the i3 moonroof, and the new turbo charger option for home charging.  I fully loaded the i3 with all the options including premium sound (which kicks!), moonroof, parking assist and technology packages.  We immediately tinted the windows and are completely satisfied with the appearance.  The i3 turns heads!  I do wish factory tinted windows were an option, tinters struggle significantly with the i3 windows and a factory product would be much better.  I travel to and from work daily around 50 miles per day so the i3 is ideal.     - Before buying an EV we had to transition our minds to understand the design focus on weight reduction and power use.  We asked ourselves; “how much will miss the big BMW tires, the extremely full feel of and comfortable seats that adjust with a touch of buttons, the Heads-Up Display (HUD), Blind Spot Indicator System (BLIS), etc.”?  You can get allot of GOOD amenities with “todays” fuel powered vehicles and when weight really doesn’t matter.  However, the i3 is so different that it’s an easy transition to make and is so simple to use!  Do we miss those items?  Yes and no.  It’s actually fun to embrace helping earth be just a little less negatively impacted (e.g. meeting the global goal of reducing carbon monoxide).  Please know I researched the i3 for months and watched every on-line review and consumer feedback… well, I’m sure I came close.  I also test drove an i3 and thoroughly researched where BMW is headed in the future.  I feel confident to say that ""today"" BMW is a front leader in EV investments and are just a few years from a dramatic upgrade in overall capacity, which is why I leased over buying (technology is RAPIDLY changing every year).     - I have to admit, I love the way BMW is making information/content of value available in the drivers decision-making domain (dashboard/windshield).  I'm a big consumer and believer in hands free information of value on-demand e.g. I want to speak what I want and then see it or receive it in a way that does not interfere with safe driving.  I also want driving to be as effortless as possible.  Power is important but driving in America, unlike other countries like in Europe limits speed and therefore for me amenities matter more (but I still go 0-40 in the i3 in 1.8 seconds; can you imagine how fast it will be in 2020!).  I also want excellent visibility and a brand I can depend on.  BMW service is important to me and is above average compared to others.  The i3’s two floating dashboard displays are easy to see and I am so glad they’re NOT touch screens.  Touch screens distract drivers and the last thing I want is another screen to clean daily.  I plug the i3 in, it charges during low rates for Georgia electric and I’m never out of electric fuel.  I can tell the i3 with my iPhone to cool off, heat up, lock or unlock, fuel during certain hours, etc.  The i3 parks itself and the cruise control is incredible as it automatically keeps the distance between vehicles and adjusts speed based on that vehicles speed in front of you.  We are surprised about the interior storage for running errands and the i3’s rear doors make accessing the rear seats so easy.  I find it hard to be critical of anything so far because BMW did such a good job thinking this design through the “driver/occupant” challenges/wants.  I encourage everyone thinking about an EV to research it and think seriously about a BMW, especially with the federal and other rebates still available (helps reduce cost of ownership).  Overall, we easily give it 5 out of 5 stars but we will see over time.  If the scale was 10, I would say a 9 out of 10.  A 10 for me is extremely hard to achieve…. I wish the i3 was equipped with Heads-Up-Display and BLIS (just to increase safety).  I also wish there was mesh storage on the back of the seats.  And, I can’t help wishing it had run flat tires and a solid metallic paint option.  Other than these personal wants, the i3 is so far, well-above expectations.  GREAT job BMW!

It's the 2017 Rex Terra world.  Most of my driving is highway and oh what fun it is.  Looks small from outside, especially from the rear, but inside you feel you are in a spacious car of the future.  The handling and comfort are most surprising for an electric car and even more surprising is the acceleration and control you have.  Some things about the car take a little time getting used to, such as the regenerative breaking.  But after a few days, it becomes so natural you soon realize this should be in all cars.  The back seats fit only two adults but in the two times in the eight months I have owned the car, I have had someone in the rear seats only twice and they were quite comfortable.  I'm glad I got the Rex which provides a generator to charge the batteries as you drive to go an additional 80 to 90 miles.  That's more than an hour of driving until you find a gas station.  I've only been to the gas station a few times.  Most drivers would not even need the Rex but it does help with the Range Anxiety.  The maintenance on this car is just about none.  I drive 80 miles to work and back each day.  I have enjoyed the quiet comfortable ride every day.  My average speed is 75 mph on the highway and I look forward to driving every day.

Acceleration is amazing and the quiet is just sublime.  Good sound insulation also protects the interior from external noise as well as the lack of engine noise.  We've had no problems; range is as advertised.  Installed a 220 v 40 amp charger in the garage that is very convenient.  Haven't had to use the Range extender yet, though my wife told me she got a notification that the engine was cycling, presumably just to keep the fluids from settling too much.  Enormous headroom; I'm 6'4 and have another 2"" beyond the top of my head.  Visibility is excellent.  The rear seats are quite usable but wouldn't buy it if we anticipated using them a lot.  Lots of trunk space.  Only gripe is that the BMW technology integration is a bit wonky and takes some getting used to.  Would have loved to have electric seats, but I suspect that would have added significant weight.  Carbon fiber body is really nice as is the interior wood.

Doors – this does not get much cooler than that. Exposed carbon, electric locks, kids (and adults) go crazy with this kind of stuff.Overall lines of the car are great very futuristic and a joy to look at every day.  And the “open space airflow"" below the trunk? My wife told me three times the trunk was open when I took her out the first time. Same goes for the interior  - functional, good looking and to the point.  Lastly – do love the concept of “power on demand”. You can be chilling on battery, taking it easy and if you need to – flip it to the left and you got some serious ooooompf…. Love it.Now the rest of it:Power .. Power … Power…:The car is too slow. Well – I guess it is ok when you compare it to some regular cars but it is definitely not when I compare it to my Nissan GTR or 911 Turbo. It is a 4 second car, where it should have been a 2 second car. It is not an “economical car” – not with 18 miles of battery range (never once had it at 20 as promised), and it is not a really fast car either – not with 1.5 liter in the back. Who was BMW competing with building this? Their own M3? I don’t think the M3 folks are target buyers of this car anyways. So I do think they missed the mark here. They should have competed with the 911 Turbo, with the GTR, with the McLaren and the likes. I8 has everything going for it except the power to be a supercar except power. I don’t think I will ever use the rear seats – nor anyone else I know that would. Get them out, make some flat storage area there and put a 500+hp 6 in the back instead of the 1.5 liter. Same with the little trunk in the back – don’t need the damn thing if I can get 3 additional cylinders instead. So the verdict is – put a big 6 in the back, get 700-800hp total of the complete setup and sell it for 175-190k. As of right now – I am not going to keep it when the lease expires. Hope the next 911 turbo is a hybrid and it is done right. Reliability:Well  - standard BMW per my experience. i.e. – it will break, question is how bad. So far had it in the shop for fuel tank valve replacement. Damn thing would not let me open the fuel tank! Imagine you are coming to the gas station no battery no fuel and the cap would not open!!

"2449",2017-02-20,"Oscar A","2016 BMW i8 Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (1.5L 3cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6A)","This can be your dream made true","My review of the BMW i8 happens after the first 2-week ""break in period"".  Then, I may be a little influenced for the ""new-toy syndrome"". I will try to be as objective as  I can, given the circumstances.  The i8 is actually surprisingly comfortable in its own amazing skin. It needs to be. It looks like a spaceship trimmed with extraterrestrial blue and black. Every person who catches a glimpse locks eyes on it, and you needn’t be clairvoyant to read pedestrians’ thoughts, and even other drivers or passengers' minds around you in traffic lights which mostly boil down to, “What the . . . ?” while snapping a quick picture from the angle they can catch it. Graceful entries and exits are not an option, you must suck it up to make that first or last act with car. However, once inside, those doubts on daily drivability fade to a great enjoyment of driving experience and a lot of attention of all eyes around you.Aside from drawing all the stares (not a trivial thing) this car is very unique in more than one item. To begging with, the i8 is the first car in the U.S. equipped with laser beams - yes, laser headlamps giving an output of pure-white light generated by laser-excited phosphorous - totally safe for oncoming motorists (in case you were wondering).  The package with this feature will add $6300 to an already eye-opening price, but oh well, for high-beams that are 1000 times more intense than LEDs you can stretch a little. These new lights are even more energy-efficient than LEDs and are only for use as a supplemental high-beam that activates above 43 mph; the regular low-beams and the high-beams below 43 mph are regular LEDs.The i8 is a hybrid car. It uses a 3-cylinder turbo to power the rear wheels and an electric motor powers in synch the front wheels.  Only when using the relatively small 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack alone, what the EPA calls “charge-depleting” mode, will the i8 approach its EPA electricity-plus-gasoline combined rating of 76 MPGe. But, I assure you this will be for a very short sweet electric drive. In reality, the i8 averages 38 MPGe assuming 200-mile ride at  75-mph highway trip for which the first 16 miles are completed using only electric drive.Now, what everyone wants to know: how would the i8 makes the exit, leaving all hearts beating at higher rate? Well in simple words: FAST, very fast! This car accelerates like a solid-fuel rocket when eBoost mode is engaged by pressing the accelerator pedal through the kickdown switch. It delivers the kind of sustained acceleration that others have compared to the Porsche 911 Turbo. To be totally honest, that feeling is not the breaking point for me. I am more the sweet ride type of guy. With that in mind, I can tell you that driven without aggression, the i8 feels like a normal car for a routine cruising, capable of meandering through traffic like an ordinary family sedan, at least to the extent that those gaping at it allow. There’s great visibility outward, considering how low the car is, so maneuvering around the gawkers is easy. The narrow Bridgestone Potenza S001 tires, 215/45R-20 in front and 245/40R-20 in back, don’t hum on the freeway the way the wide meats do on, say, a Chevy Corvette. The i8 generates 72 decibels of noise at 70 mph—not luxury-sedan quiet but 4 decibels do make a difference when sustaining a conversation in the cabin at 70 mph.As a plug-in hybrid, the i8’s front electric motor is strong enough to propel the car all by its lonesome. In the Normal driving mode, most movement begins with only the front motor operating. Occasionally, the three-cylinder engine feels slow to kick in and deliver the intersection-clearing thrust all sport cars enthusiasts seek. Silently creeping into lanes of cross-traffic can raise concerns with unprepared passengers. Moving the shifter over to Sport mode keeps the engine fired and makes gap-shooting feel less eventful. But if you do drive in Sport mode, then be ready to add a few decibels of noise coming for the speakers in concierto with the acceleration and displacement. There are four seats, but the rears are just laughable pads more suited to cushion a football-stadium bench than to transport guests in a $150,000 car, and the space is itself hospitable only for small children, and let me stress that word ""SMALL"". The front seats, however, are extremely comfortable, firm, and supportive in all the right spots to allow long days in the saddle, although they lack the bolstering to complement the 0.95 g that the car can generate in corners. The buckets are mounted deep in a well, so there’s plenty of body structure to brace oneself against. In hindsight, the BMW i8 is an awesome car for younger generations, worthy of its astronomical price (wrongly targeting the middle-age men with 6-number salary) wanting to feel the adrenaline rush of the speed, the sweet ride of an exotic piece and the stare of many everywhere it goes.",4,2016," BMW i8 Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (1.5L 3cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6A)"

Mileage: 24,7000.                                                                                                                                                                          I own a 1991 Acura NSX and thought that I would keep it for the rest of my life.  However, along comes 2017 and the price of the 2014 and 2015 BMW i8 models drops under 100k.  I needed a new daily driver to replace my 2008 Audi TT and not finding anything better, I got the idea to ""just look and see"" if there was a car that combined the driving excitement of both my cars.  I test drove a 2011 Audi R8 (no storage space) and went to test drive the BMW Z-4.  While there, the BMW dealership had just got in a used, 2015 i8.  Beautiful exterior styling, a back seat for storage space and a luscious interior.  Got behind the wheel, started driving and knew it was something very special before I even drove off the lot.  Great handling, smooth ride (for 20"" tires), cutting-edge technology, hybrid electric/gas technology for improved gas mileage and yes;  gull-wing doors.  Off the chart coolness.  This car checks ALL the boxes.  People that know cars, know why the original NSX is so special:  lightness, smooth power, sharp steering response, visibility, reliability and everyday usability.  The BMW is this generation's new NSX.UPDATE:  I have now owned the car for 12 months.  I had two re-occurring problems.  First, I could not always get the fuel door to open when I needed to fill up with gasoline;  and second, my air conditioner would not cycle on completely after the car had been driven, parked and then restarted.  Being that the car has only been in production for three years and there are so few of them around, not much has been published about mechanical problems by other owners on the various blogs.  After five trips to the dealer service department, it turned out that I had two separate problems with the release of the fuel filler door.  The fuel pressure sensor was defective and replaced on visit #3.  On visit #5, a very attentive mechanic at BMW Pleasant Grove (Utah) did testing and concluded that a second sensor, located inside the fuel pump was also faulty.  He replaced the fuel pump and that problem was finally resolved.  A/C now seems to work fine.  The A/C system controls are very complicated as is the programming system for the radio presets.",5,2015," BMW i8 Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (1.5L 3cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6A)"

I actually like the i-drive--its intuitive once you figure out the basis menu structure.  The 20 way seats are quite possible the most comfortable seat I have ever sat on--in or out of a car.  I don't like that you can't have the 20 way seats w/o the active seat cooling.  The stopping distance is not as good as my last 335ix but still better than most.  The Run as Flat (not sure why they use the ""as""?) are the ruin of every car of this type plus the tire were supposed to be staggered but they said they ran out of the wider ones for the rear; I am almost 50 but I still want fat back tires.  Like all Bimmers the HP is underrated--but who complains about that.  It is a little lower than the 3 or 5, much lower than the 5 GT but it looks stunning.  I have never had people admire my car--this is just different enough--diff enough that the 2018 Audi A7 is its twin but the Bimmer pulls-it-off a bit better but better engine choices in the Audi (but the prices don't compare.  As to my title, I have songs/artists saved on the satellite radio which will flash ""favorite song"" on the top of the LED screen--not an audible gong or on the heads-up-display (which w/the navigation is 100% awesome) where it would be perfect except you can only save 20?  considering the price of memory that makes no sense at all.  There is also a real lack of places to store things and the one place on the lowest left of the driver's side dash is great unless you forget to close and get in as it does not break it just whacks your shin.  Engine is BMW perfect except a few grand to Dinan and you may be able to life the car into orbit.  Only gripe--typical BMW outgassing solvents/oils onto inside windshield.  There are ""m"" badges all over but its not an ""m""--great steering wheel though.   The trunk/hatch is a godsend to those of us who have had sedans for so long they forgot that a hatchback makes life easy (though I still can't figure-out how to use my foot to open--worked 2x and no idea why).  I think the new 340 drives a bit better but the 435 feel more--adult.  Problem is that the car is happiest at about 70-90 mph---and I will not drive in ""Comfort"" mode--I want suspension that feels like falling down a flight of stairs but I am a minority.   As far a looks--nothing to saw except ""wow.""  (it would be really WOW if it had fatter tires.  I may--may decide to buyout the lease and do a full Dinan package--which would make it an AWD monster--which just looks like a nice car.  If you have a lead foot the 428 now 430 is a better choice as its almost as fast and does not get 22 mpg (my driving--not the car--I have gotten virtually the same mpg in every Bimmer).  As I said, barring the conflict between the crap (but $350 each) Run as Flats and spring travel I think it needs some upgrading for my taste but its reasonable from Dinan and does not void the Warranty. Okay, I could go on all day as I love these cars but to afford one I need to work.  I would buy again--but have the suspension upgraded on day one (don't get the ""M"" adjustable suspension--it is horrific).  I would spend the money on the M Brakes.

Given the power available, my combined mpg of 22.4 is quite good. The technology is excellent: active cruise control, blind-sport monitoring, back up camera and overhead camera, an excellent Harmon Kardon audio system, heads-up display, heated steering wheel and seats (front and rear). The only missing luxury/tech item is ventilated seats (not available on any 3 or 4-series vehicle at this time). Complaints: the front seats are good with lots of adjustments but don't quite fit me perfectly--even with the thigh adjustment, I can't get them to support my legs as well as the s-line seats on my former car (2011 Audi A4). The car is heavy (partly due to the hatch) and you feel that with acceleration and handling. BMW interiors are getting old. The all-season Pirelli's on the car are adequate for regular driving but lack grip especially in wet conditions. Finally, this is an expensive car. I got a great deal on a lightly used vehicle but brand new, this car is over $65,000! However, if you want a strong engine, good handling, great looks and technology, and the benefits of a hatchback design (lots of cargo space with easy access), it is hard to be a 4-series Gran Coupe. You'll save some money and get better mileage with a 428i/430i but the six-cylinder in the 435i/440i is a wonderful engine.",4,2015," BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Sedan 435i xDrive 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

Turbo lag is significant, I mash the pedal and for a few seconds nothing happens, throttle response is awful. I had an AWD MB SUV before this car and I could take turns faster in a car much, much heavier than I can in this, handling sucks. Car is way too low to the ground, the seats are the most uncomfortable car seat I've ever sat in, my feet go numb frequently because I can't get comfortable. Interior quality is awful, but then I suspect it is with every BMW, interior trim and materials are already starting to flake and peel off after only 1.5 years of ownership. Cargo and storage is decent. Navigation has to be the worst nav on the market, I used Google Maps on my phone at the same time as the vehicle system and I've stopped using the car's nav as it frequently gets the directions or street names wrong. The included cell phone charging cradle in the center armrest is friggen retarded, the only way my phone fits is if I take the case off and who the hell wants to do that? It takes all of the storage from the center console, after this there is only enough room for a pack of gum without covering the USB port in here. And of course all the cars at dealerships have to come packaged with this dumb charger, have the folks at BMW ever used a modern cell phone before? What are they thinking? USB ports are in the worst place possible, you can't both plug something into a USB port and have usable storage or drinks in the cup holders. Climate control doesn't have a sync option which many cars at this level do. My parking assistant and aid frequently doesn't work and nearly every time I back up I get a warning telling me not to rely on it and back up on my own. The lack of android auto but inclusion of apple car play is confusing, why offer one and not the other? Use of Spotify via the BMW app is spotty (no pun intended), sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've had the car for 1.5 years and already had to replace the water pump, and after a few months of ownership one of the tires needed to be replaced, another $400 bucks down the drain. And now trying to get out of this damn lemon, my resale value is nearly half of what I originally paid for the car, went from $43,000 to $25,000 resale value in 1.5 years, now that is some depreciation! Long story short don't buy this car, get the A5 sportback which is a way better car, albeit for a bit more money.",4,2017," BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe Sedan 430i SULEV 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

I wasn't impressed by the generic styling of the MB's exterior so thought I'd give the BMW 5 Series a try.  Nice car but it didn't offer exactly what I was looking for, namely, high mileage with visual appeal.  Then I saw a car that I never knew was available until I was at the dealership -- the 403i Gran Coupe with Luxury Package.  It checked all of the boxes for me, great highway mileage (34 EPA Highway;  but I've averaged about 10- to 15% higher at a steady 75+ MPH in Comfort mode), safety, comfort (I'm 6'5"" & 215#), high quality entertainment system with large screen navigation and storage space.  Rear Seat comfort?  Ok for short jaunts -- my only sacrifice vs the 530i.  Storage space?  Incredible!  This thing is a hatchback with about half of what my SUV holds (MB GLE350).  The front seats are extremely comfortable, the steering is very direct and the iDrive 6 is amazing, especially with Apple Play.  Performance?  More than sufficient for my needs.  I cannot rate reliability with only 1,500 miles on the odometer, however, J.D. Powers rates the GranCoupe higher than the 3 and 5 Series as ""Better Than Most"".   Best of all it was $5k less than the comparable 5 Series.  Yup, out came the checkbook.

There are some down sides like gas consumption, I average 19 mpg. The bluetooth doesn't alway connect perfectly. It can be a bit bumpy if the road is a bit rough maybe it's because I have the M-Sport package with the bigger wheels and low profile tires. it doesn't perform as well as a Porsche but I'm not racing it on the track so it's perfectly fun in regards to handling and performance. it's 10K less than the cheapest Porsche though and they don't even have a hardtop. I get lots of looks and complements. Best of all it's a Coupe when I want and even quieter trip but with the press of a button, have my personal transformer.

If you don't track, the z4 with the N54 engine will be more than enough performance for your daily use. Also, the hard top gives you a sense of security versus any of the soft cloth top, plus looks way better when top is up. Since the new z4 will come only with a soft top, I will just keep mine until the wheels fall off. There's really not many choices if you want a modern hard top roadster (all come to my mind are z4, slk/slc, sl, Ferrari California, mx-5).

The Boxster felt like it was pulling you around corners. The Z4 makes you have to pull it around corners. Subtle distinction, but noticeable. Definitely don't regret the trade in though. It's faster than most muscle cars off the line (not a new Stingray though). 0-40 mph before you can blink, and the auto- and paddle-shifting are FAR faster and smoother than you could ever possibly do with a manual transmission.

"2601",2015-11-17,"Dave Hill","2015 BMW X5 M SUV 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)","2016 BMW X5M vs X5 xdrive50i","I originally ordered an xDrive50i and, while waiting for that vehicle to be delivered from Spartanburg, decided to upgrade to the X5M. I debated it quite a bit during that month, trying to weigh the value of what I was getting for my extra $30K - for such a premium as this, would it be worth it? What do you get for that? The obvious answer is a performance edge - a half second off the 0-60 time, higher (limited) top speed, better handling (.96g skidpad vs. .81) and stronger braking (152 ft 70-0 vs 172 ft 70-0). The xdrive50i performs like you would expect a nice luxury SUV to perform, while the X5M performs like a supercar. Is this meaningful though in day-day operation, especially over the M Package xdrive50i? Probably not, if I'm being honest - no way you can tap the full potential of the X5M on the streets. If you're being halfway sane, at least. Oh, and with it's quad exhaust, the X5M sounds much nicer too - a deep roaring baritone exhaust note when you lay it down.Outside of performance, the X5M has a meaner look from the outside - sitting lower to the ground than the xdrive50i. I love the wheels and the spoiler which add to it's aggressive styling. And it is available in Doninngton Gray, which is (I think) one of the nicest finishes I've ever seen. There is M badging everywhere, which doesn't mean anything to me (or most people). But, if you're into status, whatever. I like how understated the X5M is - its aggressive exterior non-withstanding, it doesn't look like it should be as fast as it really is.On the inside, the only real difference I can see (besides further M badging) is the amazing front seats - I was coming into the X5M from an older 7 series. The xdrive50i had seats much like my old 7 does. The X5M has nice side bolstering that keeps you confidently in place. Some reviews on the seats were mixed - I find them to be firm, but really, really comfortable. I read reviews on the ride quality as well, given the stiff suspension - I find it rides better than my 7 did (although I went with the 20"" wheels vs. the 21"" - I think the extra rubber helps).There are a few downsides (besides price) - full efficiency is terrible. I'm less concerned about cost as I am the fact I find myself at the gas station every 4-5 days. I also think some of the controls and the iDrive could be more intuitive. Nice to have all the customization options, but challenging to get used to. Also, given it's heft and high ride height, it doesn't deliver that ""rides on rails"" experience I got with my 7 series. There is a hint of lean in corners and although it sticks really well, I don't (yet) have the confidence to hit the curves like I would like to. I like that you can customize the lift-gate opening height, but am wishing it could auto-sense and stop if it finds an obstruction from above. It's a nit, but I find that if I have it set to either of the two highest settings, it actually makes contact with the ceiling of the parking garage. If I have it at the third highest setting, it doesn't, but then offers somewhat limited access. So I have to manually adjust based on the setting for ideal operation, when I feel this could be automated.Finally (and this is more of a BMW thing than an X5M specific thing), I found myself at the dealer being pushed on a bunch of additional protection plans (wheels and tires, windshield, front end protection, wear and tear insurance, extended warranty, extended maintenance, lo-jack). I ended up paying $18K extra. I would have liked more time to explore these options than I was given. I asked it I could add them within the first 30-90 days and was told no - you must do it at time of purchase. I said yes, before really getting into the details on what was afforded there. That's a lot of money to spend on the spot. I'm glad I did it though, given this is the first really (really) nice vehicle I've owned and want to keep it perfect for as long as I can.Overall, very very happy with the X5M...",5,2015," BMW X5 M SUV 4dr SUV AWD (4.4L 8cyl Turbo 8A)"

The performance and reliability are excellent but the software and related technical aspects are a pain and I defy anyone to remember how to use all the different nick nacks. If I have a gripe, it is the suspension which, although it is better than the previous model - it could not have been worse - is still substantially worse than the Porsche Cayenne Turbo with which it competes. They have tried to substitute big rubber for suspension sophistication and it does not work. There is also no ride height adjustment which the Porsche has and this seriously limits the car's off road ability. It is a good car on tar make no mistake, just not a great one and off-road it is a joke.

While I was waiting for the M5 Sedan being redesigned, I chose to buy X5M 2018 model. I did the required research, met with my BMW well informed Sales Advisor and made the decision, having regard to the fact that the X5M is built in Spartanburg, BMW's largest and global manufacturing plant for X series and the M design engine on X5 model isn't being redesigned. I wanted a safe SUV with all the bells and whistles. I decided to take delivery of the car from the Performance Center in Spartanburg. That experience, along with the factory visit wherein I saw robots assembling X series in the assembly lines is simply an awesome experience. In the Performance Center, I drove X5M and literally touched and felt its power for ABS, DSC, off-road stability, etc. The SUV is an exhilarating combination of power and elegance. With 567 and 553 HP and torque, you have to be extremely careful to not step on the gas. It handles very well, is beautifully appointed and aesthetically awe inspiring. The breaking is admirable for the power and weight of the SUV. As noted in Edmunds review, in the Sports Plus config, the suspension is more stiff with less comfort on the wheel and when in low speed, acceleration requires more effort.  Overall, it is the best value for money as the standard vehicle is fully loaded and you don't need to choose different options.Above all, the most important aspect is the exemplary service I received throughout the sales process from the Tom Bush Blanding Blvd, Jacksonville, FL dealership in working with me on the sale, and the superb service I received from Jorge Guardincerri, my Sales Advisor.
