I've owned BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, Porsche 911, and Mercedes SL 55 and a Honda Pilot.  The SQ5  is a combination of all of them.  Its rides very comfortably, very stable, and quiet, sporty and with a lot of power and torque. Its a get up and go car, great to drive anywhere in the city or country.  I love the quality and the very advanced technology I feel like I'm in a spaceship.  I've tested the Volvo XC90, it had a very bouncy air suspension and I didn't quite trust their NAV system. I also test drove the RX 350, but again the ride was not as smooth and it just didn't absorb the bumps well, plus it was quite boring to drive. I've never test drove an Audi before until my wife wanted to look at the Audi Q7. After we bought the Q7, I just fell in love with it and had to have one just like it.  The SQ5 is a combination of sports car and comfortable SUV, very adaptable to all my different driving needs.",5,2018," Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

Before buying, I compared it to the new F -Pace S, XC60 T8, 43 AMG, and upcoming redesigned  X3 M40i. With Audi SQ5's standard adaptive dampers, you get the best comfort, but also great sportiness when desired. The volvo is for my taste too soft and floaty, while the others are too harsh for a daily driver even with adaptive dampers. Even when driving back-to-back the Lexus RX and the SQ5 on my backroads, I found the SQ5 quieter and soaking up bumps much better than the Lexus RX while being faster at the same time. The virtual cockpit and the modern entertainment system are truly the best and most updated in their class, ahead of other competitors. Having google maps in a 12.3"" screen in front of you w/ live traffic info is unbeatable. The XC 60 T8 comes close, but its infotainment system is rather laggy and ergonomics are not well though-out as everything, incl. heater, are adjusted w/ the main screen. So if that main screen does not boot up quickly or correctly you are basically left in the dark not being able to adjust anything. As confirmed by the recent reliability survey from consumer-reports, Audis are very reliable particularly compared to other luxury brands. Volvo and Jag are the bottom brands in this respect. All in all, it is the best grocery getter I have owned that pertains a dual-personality of keeping the rest of the family comfortable driving from A to B, but yet having the option of embracing windy and twisty roads with speed.",5,2018," Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

"7",2017-07-16,"Aspen SQ5","2018 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)","Exceptionally balanced vehicle","Ive owned alot of cars since the late 70's, mostly BMW and Porsche. Ive owned 5 M3's, 2 M5's, 4 911's and more recently X5's, a Cayenne and even an X3M. Then I bought a 2012 Audi A8L and fell in love with the brand. Bought wife an Audi allroad and wanted something a little sportier. Wen to the dealer intending to look at the S4/S6/7 line and was considering the S5 sportback. All of the aforementioned is only for context. Im an older guy who appreciates performance and yet I have a perspective of how much performance a person can actually use on the street. I also enjoy a modicum of practicality and so many new cars today offer both that could only be dreamed of 10 or 15 years ago. The SQ5 is without a doubt the best balance of both comfort and performance I have encountered to date in an easy to live with package. Simply amazing the choices we consumers enjoy today. I considered a Macan but the usual Porsche buying experience is a turnoff. Additionally, my local Audi dealer was terrific to deal with and frankly, the SQ5 technology embarrases the Macan as well as the driving dynamics of the 2018 SQ5 feel far superior to the older platform that underpins the Macan. You can't go wrong with the SQ5 and be sure to get the virtual cockpit option.",5,2018," Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"
"8",2018-04-22,"Ajay","2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)","A rare find!","I have owned a 2006 BMW X5, 4.4V8, 2009 Mercedes ML350, 3.5V6, and now this supercharged German beast! I have driven over 4000 mi. in about 6 weeks mainly urban commuting. The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly ""Mickey Mouse ears"" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21"" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs.",4,2017," Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"
"9",2017-03-21,"Tom","2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)","What a Cayenne Turbo driver thinks of this car","This will surprise you. Forget the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. The only real competitor to the SQ5 is the Macan S. If you've had fun in your previous car, expect twice as much in the SQ5. The supercharged engine is far superior to any turbo. The power is instant and gratifying, complemented with the best engine tune in class. The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20"" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people. The SQ5 is not perfect: its only USB port is located in the passenger glove box and its adaptive cruise control does not go all the way to stop. But it stands for Stealth Wealth - people who want to drive the best without spilling the beans. I still can't believe the sleeper status of this car. If you can find one, get one with optional diamond stitching inside! This car looks best in Daytona Gray and Sepang Blue.",5,2017," Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

"14",2015-12-23,"Bart Andeer","2015 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)","What a dissapointment","If interested, you may want to read my reviews on the 2002 Audi S8 (massive engine failure despite excellent service history), 2014 Q5 TDI (Expensive Vibrator).  I also have a 2008 S5 Coupe (so far, so good but it's going soon).  So, this review is not in a vacuum, but with some real Audi ownership experience.  OK, cut to the chase - in Florida Lemon Law circus at present.  It was disappointing with delivery of the car.  The interior is made as cheaply as possible and it shows.  This is not the el cheapo standard seating.  Buzzers going off, alarms going off all the time.  Sport Utility Vehicle.  Well, utility is a joke.  Doors lock when you don't want them to, alarms and warnings going off.  Between Health & Safety and the accountants, the car is pathetic.  Can't even turn the radio off without shutting off the Navigation.   These are but annoyances really.  The real joy began on a long road trip, right after the 5,000 mile service.  About 300 miles into the trip the add oil light came on.  Pulled off into a service station and could not find the oil dip stick.  Called the dealer (Reeves of Tampa, of whom I've been dealing with with the other Audi's and Porsche and think highly of) and informed that they don't have dip sticks.  Well, the upshot of the trip was that I would add maybe 1/3 of a quart every 500 miles.  The day I got home I brought it in and they had it for about a week, said it was fixed and within 110 miles it was telling me to add oil again.  They then had it for two weeks (Total 15 days for Lemon Law) and again the light came on.  Now the purpose of the car is my commute to work, from Tampa, FL to outside New Orleans, LA.  I can't be late looking for Audi dealers to see if I really need oil or not.  So, I then started the Lemon Law process.  Audi had 10 days to respond, but took 14 days.  I took the car back to Reeve for the final repair attempt.  They are allowed 10 days, but took 15 days.  I was told it was fixed, but the lights are on again.  The Better Business Bureau that one must go through stated today that Audi considers the car fixed.  Funny, I just took it to the dealer again today to have them manually check the oil before my next road trip.I'm totally disgusted with Audi Engineering (which seems to be run by accounting these days) and their customer support.  I have not ever had anyone from Audi give a courtesy call and sincerely state that they are sorry for my situation.  Rather, they just basically ignore the timelines set forth by the State of Florida.  Now whether that is due to arrogance, incompetence or being understaffed (due to more accountant management) I can't say, but it is not very impressive what ever the case is.  I requested that this be resolved by 23 December as I have to travel for business again, but that request was not acknowledged.""Truth in Engineering""???  maybe they should revise to ""Truth is, it's Value Engineering"".  Just a suggestion....Update.  While waiting for the arbitration hearing I took it in for the 15,000 mile service with the agreement that there would be no tampering or repair attempts.  After the service the yellow oil idiot light does not come on.  Fixed, well, not exactly.  I took it to another mechanic, had him drain about 2 qts of oil out and that yellow oil light still won't come on, and the computer screen is now different.  Hmmm, change the oil and these things magically change as well.  I'm letting the Federal Trade Commission & FL Attorney General's Office figure that out.  The complaint is under Unfair & Deceptive Business Practices. Finally had the Florida Arbitration Hearing, they ruled in my favor (3-0) but the law is so lame that the settlement was not acceptable to me.  Again attempted to settle this with Audi & Reeves Tampa Audi to no avail.  Now waiting for a court date under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Nearly one year sense the problem started.**Update**  One week prior to the pre trial hearing we went to mediation.  Volkswagen decided after a very brief negotiation to give me essentially what I had been asking for for over a year and pay my attorney's fees as well, and of course that the poorly engineered and overpriced piece of junk (my opinion) back.  I am actually getting rid of my other Audi, an S5 coupe this week.  I want nothing to do with Volkswagen or the local dealership (Reeves Audi of Tampa) in the future due to the way I've been treated.  I have been a gentleman through this entire process, but was bullied, lied to and had the dealership play games which have been reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Attorney General's office for unfair & deceptive business practices.  Used that dealership for 15 years with Porsche & Audi.  No more!Just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing more to add, other than I can't imagine myself ever purchasing another product under VW.Again, I just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.

Great acceleration and stopping power for a performance vehicle.  The quality of craftsmanship/materials is outstanding.  Love the interior design and seats...very comfortable and have great support. The carbon-fiber trim and matte chrome trim in the dash and doors add a very nice and elegant touch.  Love the Google maps feature and wifi hotspot feature.  The Bang and Oulfsen sound system is first rate in a vehicle in this price category.

This vehicle scoots!","I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn’t get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best “practical” choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good – Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can’t say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5” screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own.

I wished the ride wasn't so hard and seats so unforgiving. But that's the tight ride quality sacrifice, it is a wickedly fast beast and can handle itself easily with all that going on.

I maintained my Audi religiously through the dealership, all recalls were done when notified. At 80,000, (2010?)suddenly I had to start adding oil b4 the next oil change service. I questioned the dealership and was told that was to be expected because of the age of the vehicle & to keep adding oil. This continued for 2 1/2 years, and being continually reassured by the dealership. The oil light was coming on more frequently, I kept adding more oil. 2 months ago I went to a different dealership-(the original dealer is no longer dealing in Audi). They told me my pistons were bad, something had been manufactured incorrectly and there had been an issue that Audi knew of. To rectify the problem would cost me $6000. - again the dealer told me to just keep adding oil.  I checked into it on the internet- class action suit years 2008-2011. My car is an early 2012-manufacturered 02/12. Contacted Audi told me to pay 4 an oil compression test, which didn't happened in time. My car is currently sitting in my driveway,@ 109,000 miles, undriveable and awaiting a tow truck because it suddenly does no more than 23 miles an hour.  Audi's not sure what my out come will be!?

The brake rotors and pads were replaced at 19000 miles. I should have questioned this service at such low mileage--big mistake. I take excellent care of a car and drive it in a very sensible manner. It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated.

I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet.

So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I'm controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don't always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let's not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier ""touch"" controls and less issues.",3,2012," Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Premium quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that's on top of the $399 price tag for the 'normal' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven't even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi's were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I'm not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless.

There has never been a time that I’ve driven this car that I haven’t gotten aggravated to no end with its stupidity. Let me paint a picture about their pre-Sense anti collision assistance. Driving down the New Jersey Turnpike I proceed to pass another car. Turn signal on, drift in the left, start to accelerate and BAM! ABS is activated intent on stoping this car. Well. needless to say I get the sign a peace from the gentleman behind and and really Obnoxious horn beeping. Rightfully so.I look like an idiot that pulled out and tried to stop.  That happen twice. The dealer tells me they’re aware their pre sense  is very sensitive and it’s for my protection. really there wasn’t even a car in front of me.   Issue number two. The transmission.  When I start out from a stop  The transmission has to decide what gear it supposed to be in before we go, clunking and banging . OK off we go. the transmission  is interested in doing one thing and that’s getting into the highest gear Possible before you go 15 feet no matter what your input is. You would think? being a perceived highline German car Audi would’ve engineered out this unsophisticated jolting and horrible mapping of a transmission.  The paddle shifters are a toy. the car will override your imput whenever it feels like. Even in manual mode.   Let’s talk about Aceleration. Better yet here’s an exercise if you’re so inclined to test drive one. On ramp simulation. Bring the car down to about 5 miles an hour, now there’s room to Merge in. Consider allTraffic is doing 60 to 70 miles an hour. so punch the Pedel  to the floor. I guarantee there will be a three second delay before that car moves. pretty scary with your nose out in traffic.  There are other issues but I think you get my point .I would seriously think long and hard and test drive the hell out of this car if you decide to consider. From experience your dealership will be no help. Audi corporate could care Less and will send you back to the dealer telling you that all is normal.All that being said I will say that once the car gets moving it’s comfortable, it’s not quiet and you need to pay attention to keep it straight.

But, I found the center console technology had to get used to, dial this, push that, if there a 3 lines on one side there's another menu, a plus on the other side of the screen meant another menu. Dial, menu, dial, menu. There is NO room in the console, no place to put your phone, very hard to reach cup holders, and a center console box that is so small it wouldn't hold a small box of Kleenex. The shifter moves back and forth for reverse, neutral, and drive pressing one button, but there was a separate button to push for park... and no noise alerting you to being in park. The car is so quiet,  and the radio is still on until you open a door, half the time I didn't remember if I turned the car off. And the worst thing I could not get used to was no memory seats that side back when you get out of the vehicle, and no remote start. Remote start is not available in any Audi. I traded it in after only 2 months, and  it lost $10,000 in value!

These were an important option due to many hours spent highway driving.  Lots to know about this vehicle.  On the positive side, the handling and acceleration are impressive for and SUV. 20 Inch rims are attractive and do not seem to add any ride harshness. The ride is ultra smooth, quiet, and serene, making long trips a pleasure. The interior is elegant as is typical of all Audi's. Virtual dashboard is amazing and along with the heads up display aids keeping the drivers eyes on the road.  Adaptive cruise control works smoothly and effortlessly, Lane keeping assist is interesting and fun to experience.   Some niggling issues are the slow response from the transmission when shifting into reverse and attempting to do a quick maneuver such as a three point turn.  Apple car play works well but have lost some of the Spotify features found on my BMW interface, such as, saving a favorite song to my play list.  TPMS only tells you when there is a problem but does not show actual tire pressure. Less than 4K miles so far, no issues that would require attention from the dealership.

End 6/18 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)","Comfort Seats are “Discomfort Seats”","Had a loaner 2017 premium plus for 3 weeks waiting for an ordered 2017 A6 to arrived. Loved the A6 Prestige so much I ordered a 2018 Q5 for my wife as soon as the adaptive cruise and other packages were available. It was equipped with comfort seats and everything else except warm weather package because the 2017 comfort seats were comfortable and the 2017 sports were very hard, narrow and less comfortable. The initial release cars were not fully equipped and the dealer did not have but 1 or 2 demos to test, not were we told the 2018 Q5?seats were being redesigned. From what others now say, the vented warm weather sports seats of the 2018 were made more comfortable,  though the seat bottoms and back still are very narrow with stiff plastic at the edge of the bottom and narrow upper bolsters. We waited 3 months to receive car and drove on short trips around town for a month. Then, took 2 hour trip ( 4 hours round trip) with spouse.  Both of us could hardly walk when it was over, and it took a couple days to get back to normal. From that point on, every time we sat in the Q5, our backs and bottoms began to hurt so much we couldn’t drive it any longer. The 8-way seats do not provided enough adjustments to fine a sweet spot and we could not live with the narrow seat bottom with hard sides, the lacked lumbar support for the passenger/limited height adjustment for driver, and very little upper back support. Plus the rear of the seat bottom cupped our bottoms in such a way as to cause pressure on our lower back. The dealer offered to buy it back as a used car and we took about a $10k hit, which was a bit better than if I had trued to trade. In hindsight, we should not have rushed to buy the 2018 Q5 just because we liked my 2017 A6, though it was a very cool looking, well engineered and popular vehicle around here. I personally loved the Infotainment and vehicle technology systems because they were so easy to use and were controlled from the center console, not on a touch screen. Plus, I got 31+ mpg on the one trip using the adaptive cruise/lane keeping to control the car. Only after we had to go looking for a substitute did we learn that the 2018 Volvo XC60 Inscription which came out after we ordered the Q5 offers all that the Q5 offers with great comfort and just a bit less mileage. The Bottom Line: If comfort is something important, better test drive a Q5 with both kinds of seat configurations on a trip of at least an hour or so before buying. The comfort seats are anything but comfortable. They could bring on back troubles that never were anticipated. Moreover, unless the buyer has narrow hips and back, fitting into the design offered by Audi will be challenging. Even if the buyer’s body fits in the seat compartment, he/she may not find an adjustments that allows for comfortable positioning.",2,2018," Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Prestige quattro w/Prod.

Better cabin material,  technology was very advance, cabin noise is low during cruising, car handing was good, technology is not intuitive.The Bad.ABS activation at 24/25 MPH produce 2-3 clicks that driver can feel thru the gas pedal and can be heard by passenger.  Pre-sense is way too sensitive for NYC.  On numerous occasions,  while parallel parking.  The car breaks itself for no reason.  I was going less than 5 MPH with absolutely nothing behind or on the side.   This wouldn't be a problem if it can be permanently disabled but this requires going thru the 5-6 steps in the menu system to disable it every time the car starts.The RMP/throttle seems low when car is in reverse.   While releasing the break in reverse (without stepping on the gas) you can feel the car vibrate as it was going to cut out.  Obviously it doesn't cut out but surely it shouldn't vibrate.Honestly, I felt my switch over from the X3 to Q5 was a bad choice.   I end up paying more on a monthly basis thinking the 2018 Q5 was a step up.  In technology sense it was a step up, but my expectation of the basic car functions was missed.   Bottom line.

The Q5 is definitely a match, stride-for-stride, much to my surprise.  My two first impressions in the vehicle were ""fit and finish"" in the interior and the sound system by Bang and Olafsen---they were my ""deciders.""  Now, after 4 years of Audi ownership, I'd again cite the fit and finish, the sound system, but would add the quiet ride, the confidence I have in the vehicle, and the support I have received from the dealership's service department.  Owning the Q5 has been a very positive experience.  On the negative side of the ledger has been, of course, the tremendous depreciation, which I suppose is common to all highline vehicles.  I experienced that with the Mercedes, and am so doing with the Q5, despite the excellent care it has received from both the dealership and me.

I've driven many different types of cars, trucks and SUVs in my lifetime (I'm in my fifties) and have never really owned a vehicle that I would say hit the ideal sweet spot or did just about everything.  But the Q5 does just that for me. Interior: beautifully laid out with comfortable seats for the long ride and leather surfaces where the leather looks new all the time with no cracks because Audi does not stretch the leather. Electronics take awhile to learn but are fairly intuitive. Exterior: very German, very nice lines, turns heads. Ride:  smooth and comfortable. Ignore all those reviews that talk about the suspension being overly stiff. I wouldn't even use the word ""stiff"" to describe it. Yes, it is firmer than a Lexus or a Buick but those cars are just too soft and feel like minivans to me. The Audi feels sportier and absorbs the bumps nicely but you are still connected to the road. Handling: steering is precise or sloppy and cornering is very good unlike other SUVs with some body roll when entering an interchange which is not unusual for the height of this car or class. I have not driven in the snow yet so cannot comment but rain was very good. Power: very responsive and great acceleration off the block and at passing speeds. More power than you would ever need. Can tow up to 4,400 pounds which is very good. Safety: Excellent ratings by the government and top safety pick by IIHS. The blind spot indicators on large mirrors are very helpful. Disappointments: the lumbar seating adjustment could be a bit firmer for me, but not too bad. Could have more storage for spare change (I use the ash try which is very small). The phone charging takes place in the glove compartment so your phone is not handy although it is connected through bluetooth.

Of course, when you're driving long distances (on highways) is when you want to listen to music!  There is also a hesitancy when trying to enter a highway from a stop or slow speed - you jam the gas pedal to the floor and the engine takes a couple seconds to respond.  Like it's saying to itself, ""I think he wants us to go now, so let's get going.""  Not good.  Once engaged by the transmission, the 2.0 has enough pickup, so it's not the engine.  It's the transmission engagement that is slow. Lastly, it used hi-test gas (91 octane or higher), which makes it more expensive to run, as it only gets around 15+mpg combined.

I have another rattle coming from the cargo space cover, that makes noise every time I go over a bump, such as speed bump or when pulling into driveways. There also seems to be another rattle coming from the seat belt mount on the driver side. The sun visors will not stay up when moved up to the windshield. Living in Florida, I use the visors daily, but the quickly fall about 2 inches when put them up, which Audi has told me is ""normal.""  I have owned Chevy, GMC, Mitsubishi, Kia and Jeep, and have never encountered a problem with the sun visors staying in place.     It also seems that Audi has gone out of its way to ensure that the base model ($42,000) has as few features as possible IE: radio and electronics. Radio presets can only be operated from the dashboard, not on the steering wheel, and no back-up camera, which is basically standard on all vehicles in this day and age.

I have owned three BMW 535I (one was a 530) previous to this vehicle so I am know what I am talking about performance wise  as two had Sport suspensions.  This Audi does have all the upgrades including the 20 inch wheels and handles extremely well for a smallish 4500 pound SUV.  The acceleration of 6.5 seconds to 60 is amazing for a diesel that has ranged between 30 and 39 miles per gallon so far. I have noticed that the temperature conditions affect the mileage which must be a diesel thing but recently I got 39.5 MPG driving to Chicago on a 70 degree day going Northbound maybe I had a tail wind who knows.

Sure my car had 91,000 miles on it and had Carfax Service records.  So far after owning it for only 6 months, it's already has had to have a complete front end re-done,  hoses replaced, they still can't figure out what's wrong with the steering that 'chatters' when you turn to the left that was $3,000 worth of work.  But what has happened now is that I was noticing the anti-freeze disappearing but no leaking.  The oil cap was milky which meant the antifreeze was leaking into the engine and you could watch it disappearing.  I had the car towed to the Audi mechanic.  The warranty I bought for $3,000 isn't worth the paper it's written on, they have loop holes in it so they don't have to fix it.  Basically the engine needs to be replaced.  According to the mechanic the engine is so difficult to disassemble and tons of man hours and dollars, it's easier to replace than taking it apart.  So now I have no car to drive.

It comes as more of of a  surge, rather than the instant zippy power of a petrol motor, but when it surges, it just seems to keep producing more and more power! I chose this over the 3.2 because it is more economical and has even faster acceleration. (0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds. I won't add to the comments others have already made about the build quality and driving pleasure as I'm sure this has already been covered, just wanted you all to know that the diesel is a monster!",4.75,2010," Audi Q5 SUV 3.2 Premium quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.2L 6cyl 6A)"

The seating and access are very comfortable; the ride is sure-footed and quiet and provides feedback from the road. The experience encapsulates what German mean when they speak of ""Fahrtvergnügen"" (joy of driving = control + security + responsiveness). The cumbersome navigation system in this model and the lack of a full range of passive safety features detract from the overall score. I would have given it five stars otherwise. I bought the SUV as a certified pre-owned vehicle with 11k miles on it and a six-year warranty. Not bad.

I obviously adored my Lexus, but the new RX is huge, and the NX was a good size but had nasty yellowish pleather interior, boring handling and that awful spindle grill.   Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It's appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I'm proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.UPDATE, 12/27/2017, 1.5 years of ownership:I still love the looks and ride of my Q5.  There are things I don't love, though.  The mirrors are too big and block my view a lot, and the sun visors don't extend and aren't long enough for me (I'm 5'3"").  Voice control 'granny' is pretty slow.  The bluetooth connection with my iphone is quite variable, and the voice with google maps only works about 50% of the time (the built in navigation I don't even use, I'd much rather use my phone apps).  The a/c is not as good as the one on my 15 year old Lexus).  My windshield wiper sometimes takes a random trip across the window.  The doors are very heavy and tend to close when I don't want them to if I'm entering or exiting the car in a parking spot that isn't level.   Stuff in the back cargo area consistently shifts around a lot more than it ever did in my RX, though I'm not sure why, and I really don't like that I can't close the back cargo door with an interior button.  These are all relatively minor drawbacks, though there are many.  However, I really do love the way the car rides and handles, and it's still one of the classiest looking SUVs on the road.6/2018 UPDATE: Still love my Audi except for the MMI (controls all infomation electronics), which is has gone dead twice in 1.5 years.",4,2016," Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV's.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.

The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I'm enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I'm pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase.",5,2016," Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A)"

I loved the car then and I still do today, despite Audi's diesel fiasco.Pros:1. This is a very comfortable car to sit in on the commute and long hauls. The front seats are great unless you want to pretend it's a sports car, in which case they lack a bit of lateral support. The Q5 does its suburban transport function perfectly well and the panoramic roof glass gives it an airy feeling.  Like all the Audis in my experience, the driver's sight lines are excellent.2. The fuel economy has gone from outstanding to somewhat higher than that.  In the same mixed driving pattern since purchase, I'm now averaging 31-33 mpg measured at the tank (the low end of that range in winter).  High 30s with pure highway driving.  For a 4400 pound truck with a 5000 pound towing capacity, that's supernatural. 3. About that towing capacity; I still haven't hauled any really heavy loads but the Q5 tows 1000 pounds of motorcycle plus trailer with barely any hit on fuel consumption.4. Driving dynamics are very good within limits.  Body roll is minimal for an SUV, the steering is reasonably quick and accurate without being nervous, braking effort is linear and absolute stopping power is good but not stellar.  Ride quality is quite good, striking an excellent balance of composed cornering without too stiff damping.  While I usually don't ask much of the engine and rarely spin it above 1800 rpm, when acceleration is called for at any speed that initial torque surge is amazing.5. The Q5 is good in winter, particularly since I put on Nokian Hakkapeliitta winter tires (probably not needed but they provide more braking performance in snow).  Excellent ground clearance, the wheel wells don't get packed up with snow and the traction control is effective without being intrusive.  It would be nice to have a locking center diff but the Quattro is perfectly fine for most snow conditions.  The defroster does a good job but it would help to have a windshield option as it does get packed up with snow and ice at the base and left side of the window.6. VWAG finally has a plan to deal with the 3.0 liter diesel scam and it looks good.  Last year I got a $500 debit card for any purchase and another $500 card to use exclusively at Audi dealerships.  Now they're on the verge of recall the car to implement the fix, which appears to be limited to ECU reprogramming.  We will have to see if this adversely affects performance or fuel economy with no third party reports yet, as far as I know.  One cause for optimism is that a friend of mine with a Golf Sportwagen TDI had no degradation of mileage or performance after recent fix of his 2.0 liter I-4.  Audi will also evidently give me something in the range of $7000 compensation with a smaller amount coming from Bosch.  That will have a significant impact in cost of ownership (and might put me in a new Porsche Cayman or Corvette Grand Sport when I trade in my other car next year!).Cons:1. The steering has poor on-center feel which is a bit irritating when I set out on highway driving although after a bit of time I stop noticing it.2. While the stopping power is adequate, the initial brake feel is spongy.  I much prefer brakes that have a strong initial bite and linear rise in stopping power, like those on my Audi S4. 3. The defroster is adequate but in very snowy conditions it would be nice to have a heated windshield base or heated washer fluid.4. I would prefer to have engine stop start switch in a more intuitive position.  The system itself is not bad; the engine restarts quickly and smoothly.  But I only want to use it when I anticipate a relatively long stop, like arriving at a traffic light that has just turned red.  So I am turning the system on and off multiple times in local driving but it's hard to find the switch without taking my eyes off the road.5. The interior trim on the driver's side door and left front of the dashboard reflects sunlight on the instruments and windshield under some circumstances.  It's an occasional minor irritation.  Overall, it's hard to find much to complain about with this car!",4,2014," Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A)"

Seriously, I traded my 2002 Audi S8 which had massive engine failure at 118,000 miles for a new '14 TDI.  I commute from Tampa, FL to just beyond New Orleans, LA.  I was looking for the ability to tow a small trailer, get good mileage and like all wheel drive.  Seemed pretty good, but there was a huge catch.  Vibration.  There is something called vibration tolerance.   It seems the longer a human is subjected to vibrations, the more aggravating the particular vibrations (generally low in frequency) become.

I've been very careful during the break-in period, which happened during extreme cold temperatures and much snow and ice on the roads for a few weeks in February. The car would start flawlessly every time even at temperatures of -20 F in the mountains of Colorado. I've averaged 25.5 mpg in the city during cold weather and snowy roads. On a 180 mile round trip from Winter Park to Steamboat Springs, where you start at 8800 ft, go down to 7000, then up to almost 11,000 ft and then down to 6,800 ft I averaged 35 mpg with 5 people in the car, skis on the roof and a fully loaded trunk. From Boulder to Colorado Springs and back I averaged 41.5 MPG.Update: After owning this vehicle for two years I'm just hoping it is not too good to be true with the diesel scandal. I bought it because it had power and speed to spare while using very little fuel and polluting less than a gasoline car. That may still be true for CO2 emissions, but it is not true for NOx emissions, and that is very disappointing. I'm hoping the fix will not reduce my power or fuel economy. I've averaged almost 31 mpg over 25,000 miles, with no mechanical or electrical problems. My biggest complain is the Google Earth based GPS. The time to arrival algorithm is not very accurate, especially when driving in the mountains. It can be 30 minutes off on a two hour drive. In the city though, it is accurate enough.I bought snow tires to get one more season out of the all seasons it came with, but I still think the original tires will not last as long as expected. The Audi Q5 is excellent in the snow with these new snow tires. I did notice an appreciable difference in traction, but it does not corner as well as with the all seasons, as expected.Last year we drove the car from Colorado to California and from Colorado to the East Coast. It was such a pleasure we may do it again this year. The seats get a bit hard after 6 hours drive, so we bought a seat cushion for long trips after the first one and our bottoms thanked us.Update: The major change I've seen is my mileage has increased to an average of 31.6 of combined driving in the third year, from 30.8 the first year. I don't know if that's due to the engine loosening up and becoming fully burned in, or because the original tires are getting worn out. I have 34,000 miles and I have measured up to 40.5 MPG on one trip. Usually the computer is off by up to 1 mpg, so figure at least 38-39 mpg on the highway through 3 Colorado mountain passes.I hope Audi can fix the diesel cheating problem without affecting performance. I don't know of any other car that can perform similarly or better (range, MPG, AWD, ground clearance, acceleration, comfort, luxury, quality). Maybe next year the plug-in hybrid can come close or surpass it.Update (Mar 26, 2017): Audi may offer to buy back my 3.0 TDI Audi Q5 if they cannot solve the diesel problems by December 2017. I would take them up on the offer if I could find another vehicle that performed equally or better than what I have for a similar price.

The panorama sun/moonroof lets the light in making the already spacious cabin look even more so and inviting for your guests. For the price point, it is a smooth cruiser but one can wake up the beast by shifting to S mode. I was crossshopping current year lexus NX, Mercedes GLC (and GLK), and BMW X6 at higher price points and they did not deliver the versatile appeal yo the driver senses as the Q5 could. Although I bought mine pre-owned at high highway miles, there is no doubt it still feels and runs like new. The interior fit and finish have held up well indicative of the attention of detail befitting a German luxury mobile. The cons are that because the standard suspension is fairly sporty and firm, rough roads may be felt more but its manageable. If you can, find a Q5 with adaptive dampers and audi drive select and youll have 3+ cars of feel in one! Also, this MY has piston and ring oil consumption issues as well as timing chain tensioner flaws. Luckily it was fixed in mine. Do your due diligence and find one that has these fixes done and car will be bulletproof. MY and minor facelift (2009-2012s look better in my opinion) 2013+ Q5s seem to have these fixes done so could save you a headache. Overall, amazing bargain for the price.

And it's not as comfortable or as quiet as my A8. It gets around 18 mpg. But beyond that, it's fantastic. It has all of the great techno-baubles Audi has been delivering for several years now. Fortunately, mine does not have the bioptic adaptive cruise feature. I spent a day driving a new A8 loaner with it and didn't like it. The S7 also does not have the Eco engine cutoff feature that the other A7 models have. I find that feature distracting. The S7 is very quick and while not as capable on snow as my old 8 it seems sure footed on wet streets. It did occasionally hydroplane on deeper water because of its wide tires but I changed the tires to a more wet friendly tread and haven't noticed that problem. The 7 has been a great car with only one problem so far. The air suspension was making a noise when the car was cold. But that was last year. We'll see if it picks up again this winter. It's a very impressive, well optioned car at the price point.  I keep trying to justify buying another M or an AMG and I'm always astounded at how much more expensive they are than Audis.

It's understated elegance is perfect for me and anyone else who wants to drive an amazing car that doesn't say ""I'm trying to keep up with the Joneses"".

At 50,000 miles the ""check coolant"" message appeared every day until a visit to the dealer revealed that a new water pump was needed at around $2,000 with labor. Not 5,000 miles later the engine developed a high pitch squeal at idle. The remedy for that was a costly repair to the high pressure oil system.  Throughout the ownership of the car a clunking noise could be heard from the passenger footwell over every bump. This was never actually solved but was believed to be the front drive shaft and was replaced. Granted the dealership sympathized with me over the problems I was having and had Audi cover the cost. The adaptive cruise control went out of calibration several times and disabled the cruise until a $400 calibration was completed. Besides from the mechanical issues several interior rattles showed up in quick succession. Maintenance costs were as expected for oil changes but in order to perform the 75,000 mile service the entire front end would have had to be disassembled adding up to a $2,000 plus charge. All that aside the car itself was fantastic. The engine sounded rich and the acceleration was insane. The interior looked premium and the quilted seats were gorgeous. The exterior of the car had just the right blend of sport and luxury.

The car performs largely as advertised.  Accelleration is steady and very powerful, continues to build way past any speed at which I am comfortable to drive (and way past any highway speed limits). The dual clutch transmission is also smooth and fast, though driving with one takes a little getting used to, particularly when changing from reverse to drive or at low speeds. The sedan is also quite nimble for its size, and with the active suspension it has very little body roll. In particular, it is a pleasure to accelerate through and out of turns, let the torque vector push the car around the bends.  The interior is very quiet and comfortable, and the comfort seat package IMHO is great (I think ventilated seats are a must in a warm climate). My only gripe is that the touchpad system is terrible. Audi uses it for radio presets, and it will often mistake a touch for an attempt at setting a new preset, causing you to have to go back and re-input your intended stations. I just don't use it at all for anything but navigation entry (the handwriting recognition is good). The audio quality is solid (I didn't choose the top-level system, just the upgraded sound).

Space for cargo--although not as much as one would think--car-like handling and great style. Audi builds great looking cars. My issues are with maintenance and driving performance. MAINTENANCE: had to replace tires, rotors and brake pads at 20,000 miles. Have a mystery rattle that was never found so the premium Audi came in handy to drown it out. Great sound system. DRIVING CHARACTER: Coming from an Avante, the driving characteristics of the All Road are not as refined or sporty. Little more body roll in corners and some squirlyness on imperfect roads. I would advise not buying with the upgraded 19"" wheels as they render the car useless in snow or conditions where Quattro will be functionally useful. Look good but compromise ride quality. Ask the 8-speed dual-cutch transmission is clunky at low speeds. Finally, Audi decontented the cars packaging from the avant. Many of the handy cubbies and drawers were taken away in this iteration of their wagon class. Ironic, considering it's positioned as an activity vehicle. THE GOOD: The car does accelerate nicely when asked to and the fit and finish is really good. Cabin noise is very quiet. Looks great, alright the front end styling is a bit soft. Subjective. I'm stepping out of my All Road into the new Golf Soortwagon after looking at the BMW wagon--very pricey--the Volvo V60--no paddles on the R Design AWD--and stellar reviews on the Golf.

I have the premium quattro 4dr in all-wheel-drive and I LOVE it! My 5 main pros are: elegant exterior and interior, amazing sunroof that I would expect on a much more expensive car, great lighting system, AMAZING safety features such as parking aids, sound alerts when you're nearing objects, great safety ratings for collision safety, and an overall very smooth ride. There are a few little things I have noticed but they don't really bother me which are: gas mileage could be a bit more efficient and sometimes the acceleration does feel a bit slow. Audi was having a leasing special on this model at the time and WITH tax my lease is about $360 monthly for a great car that does look and feel luxurious. I also want to say that I literally cannot tell the difference in size from the Q models from the outside. My Q3 looks the exact same to me as a Q5 that I'll see on the road. I'm not sure why I've seen so many people comment that this is a small car, it is most definitely spacious. Especially since you can put the back seats down. I personally would never own a BMW so in comparison I'd take the Q3 over any similar models in the same price range any day.

The vehicle had 8K miles and appeared to be of decent initial quality. This, however, quickly diminished. For reference, I own a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited and felt throughout my entire time driving the Audi that it was far inferior to the Outback in almost every way. Virtually every ""convenience"" in the Audi was difficult to use. The sunroof button has 5 ""positions"", two of which did nothing and the remaining three did not consistently work. The buttons on the steering wheel are completely useless, hardly any of which control any of the media electronics. The instrument panel has the speedometer, cruise control or a few other options in at least two locations, but there is no indicator for headlights. The interior door locks don't work with the key removed. The keyfob unlock button wouldn't consistently unlock all doors, wouldn't unlock the rear hatch without using the actual trunk unlock button, and the car would relock shortly after unlocking making unlocking the car from a distance and then walking to the car without the keys frustrating as the doors would relock before reaching the car. The turning radius is horrible for a car so small. The braking system is extremely sensitive and while braking normally the vehicle would sporadically brake harder a few seconds into slowing the vehicle. The cockpit is a tight fit for me, being an extremely average 5'9"", 165lbs. The console is too wide, causing your leg to press against it while driving. Steering wheel and seat adjustment were impossible to get comfortable. The rear passenger space is quaint, not being able to fit two adults and one 12-year old or allowing any of them any legroom at all. The absolute worst experience with the Audi Q3 was driving from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles in 90+-degrees heat, slow- to stopped-traffic and a climate control malfunction rendering the air conditioning useless. The fan would audibly change settings but nothing came from any of the vents no matter how we tried to adjust settings. A few hours after reaching our destination, the climate control worked ""normally"". The only positive aspect of the Audi Q3 is that the engine does have decent ""power"" considering its small size, obviously from the turbocharger. But there is no way this car was getting 40-MPG that the trip computer was telling me. Overall, I feel the basic front-wheel-drive Audi Q3 is nowhere near the value of a similarly priced, fully-loaded all-wheel-drive Outback. A lot of the Audi felt cheap compared to the Subaru and I was extremely disappointed with the lack of quality as Audi is generally referred to as a high-quality, luxury brand. The Audi Q3 is an extremely overpriced piece of frustrating garbage. Not that I was considering purchasing a brand of vehicle other than Subaru, but if I were Audi would definitely NOT be an alternative brand I would look at.",3,2018," Audi Q3 SUV Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)"

I have a Quattro Premium Plus with Sport Package and Navigation. It was the perfect size for me as I do not have any children, nor do I haul rear passengers often (Q5 was too big). Although my previous car (2016 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited) had a ton of advanced safety features, I found them rather annoying, nor did I ever use the adaptive cruise control. I also had a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited. It was part of the oil consumption class action suit. Burned oil higher than normal and dealer tried to say it was normal. In regards to Subaru and interior quality, I've been in several other car brands and Subaru's is one of the worst. Also, don't get me started on the dreadful CVT, wind and road noise Subaru has. The only thing pleasant about Subaru was the AWD system. So, I chose Audi because I know they also have one of the best AWD systems too. The Q3 handles well, has a high quality interior, as well as a quiet and comfortable ride. Although, not everything is perfect, there are some compromises. Acceleration and gas mileage is okay.

I wanted a small SUV this time with all the bells and whistles. The dealer had a loaded AWD that we drove. I was impressed with the way it handled and drove. Living in Florida, I figured a front wheel drive would be enough for us, so we ordered a FWD Premium Plus. After delivery and driving it several times, I felt like it was not like the car we drove at the dealer. It was sluggish and hesitated at stop lights and the shift points seemed off.  I made an appointment at around 2500 miles to have it checked out. No problems were found; the Audi tech said he wanted to explain something that we may not have known when we ordered the SUV. He said the AWD and FWD have different transmissions and the AWD is more spirited and reacts when stepping on the gas, whereas the FWD is more economy minded. A light went off in my head  that answered my nagging question. Now, I have a one year old Audi Q3 that I don't find fun to drive anymore.

Both beautiful cars, but we were looking for something compact. I give the Q3 5-stars in every category but acceleration, control logic, and road noise. The acceleration is fine, just a little less gutsy than some of the Audis I’ve fricen before. The control logic is great, except for the sound system control. They’ve moved it from the main center console to the center dash console. (Edit: after driving the vehicle for 8 months I no longer notice the difference) Road noise in an SUV is almost always going to be heard, add in winter tires on weathered roads and it’s pretty much impossible to keep it quiet.

My 2016 Q3 has now 21,150 miles on it and has not missed a beat. Recently drove from Houston, Texas to Fair Haven, Vermont and back in ten days; it was a great experience from start to finish. The Q3 met every challenge along the way averaging 32.5 mph at posted speeds. Handled great, avoiding two possible truck encounters and a Northeaster that dumped 24 inches on us in Vermont.  The all wheel option did well in the snow as well as in the rain and ice.  Heated seats came in handy in 5 degree weather while the heated side mirrors made it easy to drive in the blowing snow conditions. A USB port would be nice but the Bluetooth option for Pandora and Audible made the trip a fun experience.  If you want a good value with multiple option plus good mileage, the Q3 is an SUV worth considering.Now a few more miles down the road and still enjoying my ride. On short coming is the lack of “gritty-up” to enter feeder lanes for our Texas highways; 50 more horse power would make a difference, then again Texas drivers love to go 80 in a 70 while staying on your bumper might have more to do with the sense you may be in somebody’s way creating that “need for speed”.

"536",2016-12-29,"Niles F","2016 Audi Q3 SUV Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)","One year out and still enjoying my Q3","I purchased my 2016 Prestige Q3  quattro with the Sport Package in Nov 2015 and love this SUV. I surprised myself when I bought this since I wasn’t looking for a “luxury” SUV. However, I had shopped for over a year and drove virtually every other SUV in its’ class and was just not impressed with the drive and handling (or sound systems) of the Q3’s competitors. I love how this SUV handles on winding roads and love driving it so much I look for excuses to take it out! I’ve read several reviews suggesting the Q3 may have below average acceleration and power but have not found this to be the case at all, even with passengers in the car. To me it’s like driving a sports car with an awesome sound system. Some blogs suggest you can purchase a Sprint Booster module for even faster acceleration but I don’t feel I need it. There is no lag in acceleration when I hit the gas unlike other SUVs in its’ class that I have test driven. I’ve only needed to take in for service for the first oil change/checkup; its' basically been flawless since I bought it over a year ago.Update on 1/5/18. Over 2 years out and still loving my Q3. Perhaps the most important update I can give is that after all this time (closing in on 25K miles) I have had zero issues with my Q3. Hence, the quality of Audi's vehicles has held up in my case. I've also seen where Edmonds reviews lists sluggish performance and handling as negatives for the Q3. I can't speak for later models but I'm still very happy with the peppy acceleration on my Q3 and strongly disagree with the handling point. My Q3 is a dream to drive and handles extremely well on winding and downhill roads. This was a major selling point for me after driving many other SUVS. Breaking is also smooth and dependable. The infotainment system is admittedly dated (but has worked just fine) and gas mileage could be better (though has been slightly better than advertised in my case), however, these were not my highest priorities when purchasing my Q3. My advise is to test drive a Q3 if your looking to by a compact SUV and not go strictly by the reviews.",5,2016," Audi Q3 SUV Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)"
"537",2016-12-10,"Linda H.","2016 Audi Q3 SUV Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)","The best car I have owned, truly","This is my first Audi, but I have had several VWs and they are the same ""family"".  I have owned it 6 months.  It is nimble, handles the road well and it accelerates well when I need it to.  I love back country roads with hills and corners and would call this a ""driver's car"".  If you enjoy driving, this is great for that and driving is not boring.  I already used the word nimble, but I emphasize this word here as it makes me smile and I often think ""I am one with the car"" when I drive this.  I drove in ice and snow with it for the first time earlier this week.  These were bad conditions and a 45 minute drive took me 2 1/2 hours and my Audi handled it like a champ, truly.  Other cars were spun off to the side and this vehicle stayed on track (of course I drive according to the conditions) and my car simply did it well.  As for complaints, I would say that being able to change songs on my MP3 or change stations on my radio ought to be on the steering wheel vs. the dash.  I also am waiting for my first oil change (soon) to have them do something to update my GPS maps as this car doesn't ""get"" newer construction and simply thinks I'm off-road at times.  But, aside from that, it is a joy to own and drive, so very quiet and I have to also say that not a week goes by without a stranger telling me it is ""so pretty"" and complimenting it.  Someone helped me out of a store with something heavy not long ago and stopped in their tracks and stated ""You have my dream car!"" and I did enjoy that.  Something is awfully fun about having people making a remark regularly about how nice the car is, I admit that.  I have never felt compelled to write a review before of any car I have owned, but I love this so much that I decided that I needed to share.  It is simply just a happy vehicle for me to own, I like happy!Updated, at Edmunds request at a few weeks less than one year of ownership:  I still love the car.  I'm still as happy as I was before.  It is a great vehicle and it is all the things I said previously.  I've not got about 18,000 miles on it.  People literally stop me in parking lots or gas stations to tell me what a pretty car it is, and I still love that.  I had an incident with the car where I avoided hitting a dog in the road (sadly it was running free) and hit a curb and destroyed a tire.  It needed a front end alignment after that.  Everything is fine, the vehicle handled an incident like that well and I was quickly able to adjust my driving and avoid hitting something.  It brakes well, handles well, does it all.As stated previously, my only less than perfect rating is the technology.  The radio is sluggish when you try to surf stations, not being able to change stations using the steering wheel is a negative on long rides.  The sound is good.  The GPS is ""old school"" and not a touch screen and it sometimes doesn't know where it is, forget trying the voice commands as it never gets what you say, even if it is said clearly.  An update of that would be $420 dollars at the dealership, so no thanks on that.  I have a previously purchased Garmin in the car and will use that for long trips at the same time as the navigation in this car as I now do not trust it.  One time I was in the car driving in Rhode Island and it literally placed my car out in the ocean rather than on the route.  That was truly bizarre.  Yet, 95% of the time it works just fine.  I need dependability for appointments and trips, so hence the need to have the Garmin on hand.",5,2016," Audi Q3 SUV Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)"

With the leather interior the cars smells so good!  :-)  The trunk is small-ish, so if you have kids maybe this is not the car for you - consider the Q5.

PROS: The colors are great both Inside (chestnut brown leather) and Out (cuvée silver metallic). The car holds the road firmly and has a good ride. The steering is crisp and the breaking is excellent.  Headlights are awesome when driving at night on unlit roadways.  Seats are fairly comfortable with the Sport Package that was included as an option.  However, not nearly as comfortable as the seats in an A-4.  Sight lines out of the car are great.CONS: the electronics (Nav, phone, Wi-Fi) are a little difficult to get used to, but can be handled with some practice. Heated seats take forever to warm up.  Rear view camera takes too long to turn off after shifting back to a forward gear.  The only engine available for this car, 2.0 L / 4 cylinder / TFSI, that produces 200 hp & 207 ft-lb torque, is minimally enough for the car. And that's with just me as the driver.  If I had 3 other adult passengers in the car with me, the engine would struggle even more to get the car moving. The 6 speed transmission seems to do a good job, but could certainly use more support from the engine.  And, driving the car in the ""S"" gear to get the engine more power, forget about it!  The gas mileage would be terrible for a 4 cylinder engine.I think the worst part is that this same 2.0 L engine with 6 speed transmission is used in several other Audi models. But, they have way more hp and engine torque and even get way better gas mileage.  Unfortunately, this car/crossover/ SUV paired with this weak engine does not live up to the standards set by this brand's other proven models.

I was very impressed with the ride versus my 2011 A3 TDI. So when I went back to pick up my wife's car, I decided to sit down with a salesperson to discuss the possibility of trading in my A3. The deals they were offering were excellent, and I just wasn't willing to wait to see how Audi was going to resolve the emission issue affecting the 2.0 TDI engines.So far, I'm extremely happy with my decision. The Q3 with Prestige and Sport Packages is a real step up from my 2011 A3 TDI. The ride is extremely comfortable and the cabin is incredibly quiet. Incidentally, on previous occasions, I also had the opportunity to drive the 2015 A3 Sedan for an extended period as a loaner car, and the Q3 feels a lot nicer to drive. The handling with the 19"" tires included with the Sport Package is really impressive. It doesn't handle like an SUV at all. The car accelerates very evenly and the transmission shifts very smoothly. The exterior and all of the interior finishes are just beautiful! The Bose Audio system included with the Prestige Package sounds great, and I love how seamlessly my iPhone connects (via Bluetooth) to play all of my audio files. My only disappointment is the relatively poor fuel economy for an SUV in this class. In fact, the fuel economy is essentially the same as my wife's Q5 which is significantly larger and heavier. It's especially painful because I was averaging nearly 42 miles/gallon with my A3 TDI. However, it's unclear whether or not these fuel economy figures would have been impacted by whatever solution Audi/Volkswagen comes up with to meet the emission requirements.For me, it's the perfect compromise of size, comfort, quality, and luxury. I also considered the BMW X1 and the Mercedes GLA, but these two alternatives were significantly more expensive when comparably equipped.

Heated seats work great but no cooled vented seats in my ride, which I really miss. Air con. is great though. Once you get used to MMI it's so easy to navigate. Speaking of navigate, the live google navigation is very nice to have at your fingertips. GAS Mileage you ask?...even with tune,  30mpg on highway at 65-70mph (26mpg on highway @ 85mph). City is around 20. Steering is a touch vague but extremely confidence inspiring. All in all the car is fantastic. I've owned an e39 M5, S55 AMG with tune (rocket), CTS-V, G35 and way way back an Integra GS-R (totally stock). I think for all around sporty driving and comfort for a family of 5, this one is my favorite of all. It obviously has more tech but the feel of safety and road holding is just amazing. It's just so easy to drive!    For pure driving fun the e39 was probably the cream of the crop. Although the A6 w tune is a good bit fast than the M.",5,2012," Audi A6 Sedan 3.0T Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

NEVER go to an Audi Dealer, unless you have no other choice. In my case this is $85/hr for a very good after-market shop vs $155/hr at the dealer. I recently retired my 2000 A6 Bi-turbo with 424k miles. Anyone who says Audis don't stand up over time is talking rubbish. But at such mileage almost any luxury vehicle is going to nickel and dime you. Thus, my move to the 2012 A6 Prestige.The 2012 A6 is a differently beast entirely than the 2000 A6 it replaces. Longer wheel base, wider. The supercharged 3.0  feels distinctly different than the bi-turbo 2.7, and with a re-mapping of the ECU (APR), The engine makes 400hp vs the 310 it has in stock dress. An older driver, I've always been a 'car guy', though my priorities have changed somewhat. The 8-speed automatic features paddle shifters. The Sport mode significantly tightens up the acceleration curve. While a subjective 'anecdotal' opinion, my repair shop owner who has owned and driven some of the fastest cars out there (Lambos, Ferraris, Mercedes AMGs), says my car accelerates off the line in what feels to him like a 4.6 second 0-60. The supercharger pulley upgrades I'm planning will add another 100 hp, perhaps dropping the 0-60 time to 4.2 or 4.3. At a purchase price of  $17,400 it's clearly a bargain. Audi makes 3 levels of options, the highest being what they call 'Prestige'. My Prestige 3.0T has all but two options. Getting behind the wheel to drive the 45 minute commute to work in Massachusetts is always a pleasure! Refined. Fast.

I bought the Prestige trim  - 3.0T, driver assistance package, comfort seating package, and cold weather package - with florett silver metallic exterior and atlas beige (valcona) interior. I previously owned japanese cars  - toyota or honda - that were progressively higher end trim as I got older and had more disposable income, but they were never luxury cars. I personally subscribe to the belief that if you're going to buy a luxury car, wait until you truly can afford it then get the higher end, where you notice and can enjoy the engine performance, higher end tech, interior quality etc. I still love driving my A6 almost a year into owning it. In this case with the 3.0T Prestige plus options, it was close to $70k, no doubt a high cost, but again, I waited quite some time and took care of other financial priorities first.  In owning the A6 Prestige 3.0T plus options, I notice the drastic difference between my beautiful, powerful A6 and the less powerful, pedestrian quality materials on lesser A6 versions when I use a dealer loaner. BTW, there is an important warranty option - 10 years, 120,000 miles. At this cost, meaning the high relative cost of a fully decked out A6, compared with a few thousand more for this extensive warranty, I am surprised some choose not to buy this.

Ruled out the new 5 series for fear of 1st model year run reliability woes and the 6 cylinder E class is just too expensive.   Just loved the ride and handling of the A6, it's the right combination of sport and luxury. Plus this is the only German midsize you can order with REAR side airbags  and of course outstanding crash testing. The ride and handling are outstanding. Some formal car magazine reviews had stated the steering is  numb or light but I do not have that impression. The V6  gives you power whenever you want. I purchased a factory order Premium Plus with 19"" sport package and the layered walnut. The 19"" wheels ride well without added harshness and the 10 spoke wheels look stunning when paired with Florett Silver body color. The  black headliner with black leather and layered walnut wood option make the cabin exceptionally rich.  The MMI interface doesn't take that long to figure out. Voice commands are a little slow but the map with google earth view is pretty cool. The instrument cluster driver display can be customized to show different driver info and is nearly the equal of the newer cars that have the all digital display for the driver instrument panel. The Bose stereo is  good but not great (and wasn't going to cough up $4200 for the Bang and Olufsen upgrade). Driver's assistance package work very well especially the adaptive cruise control keeping distance from the car ahead of you and lane assist keeping you in the lane. Yes it's the oldest of the German luxury mid sized sedans in terms of this version, but it stacks up well to the competition.

The only options I did not order on the Prestige Package were a Bang and Olufsen stereo, the $3300 comfort seat upgrade and night vision (The Prestige comes with 12-way ventilated seats). I also stuck with the stock 18"" 245/45 all weather tires because of their higher profile. On the plus side are its stylish look in Florett Silver with Atlas Beige/Dark Walnut interior, great handling, extreme comfort, great temperature and direction controls, wonderful visibility, well-designed driver assistance, and great parking assist (easiest car I have ever parked beside the 2017 Q5). The virtual cockpit and heads up displays are easy to use, informative and very helpful. It's great having the Nav display directly in front of the driver. The transmission shifts smoothly, and for such a powerful car, it is surprisingly quiet  when accelerating, and there is virtually no wind noise when cruising, The ECO start/stop was a little hard to get used to (abrupt stop), but I really like the fuel savings it affords around town. Speaking of fuel economy, I have been getting between 30-36 mpg on trips and averaging 25 mpg combined. FANTASTIC! I think the secret is that I allow the adaptive cruise to pretty much control the car on a trip. On the ""con"" side, the info system does take time to figure out. I spent over 2 hours with Audi Connect getting the AT&T SD card and navigation system reprogrammed, I am still learning the system. I wish all the information on the retractable Nav screen could be turned off so the entire screen displayed the route. I wish connection to the internet was included in the price like GM proposes to do on its new models. The garage door HomeLink was a bear to set. The salesman spent over an hour at my home setting it up, but it has worked well since being programmed. Dash glare is another ""con."" I had ordered the brown interior and dash trim with the expectation that dash glare would be reduced. NOT! My 2011 Volvo S80 had a similar colored dash that gave off almost no dash glare. Instead of using a grained glare-reducing material over the entire dash, Audi used hard plastic around the heads up display and other selected places which, in combination, produces a lot of reflection on the windshield. It apparently failed to engineer the windshield angle to reduce glare on the type of dash materials it chose to use. I also join others in expressing a desire that the car have a little more storage space in the front passenger compartment, but I have learned to do more with less junk in the cabin of the car. It is only these later ""cons"" that kept me from giving the car 5 stars overall. Its looks, its performance, its comfort, fuel economy, etc. all call for 5 stars. Because of some convenience issues, however, I could only give it 4 overall. (PS: The price for this category of car was in line with its competitors, and I thought the dealer treated me fairly considering the additional warranties that were included in the out-the-door price. Therefore, the price rating should be read as an N/A. It was not a factor in my ratings.)",4,2017," Audi A6 Sedan 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

I decided to open my mind and consider getting something different, for a change.  After reading the reviews, it appeared the A6 had surpassed all its competition, including the 5 series.  You know how test drives go... I didn't really get to push it and certainly couldn't appreciate what daily and practical use of the vehicle would entail.  You've read all the professional reviews which tend to ignore some of the annoyances you pick up on after owning the car for a while.  In this review, I will only focus on the negative aspects of this car (not  the positive).  In no particular order... * Bluetooth connectivity was sub-par (compared to our Lexus RX 350).  It takes far too long for  the vehicle to recognize your phone, which poses obvious problems.  If you are using the google maps app on your iPhone and it vocalizes guidance instructions over your car speakers, the  first part of the instructions are always cut off (not so on the much cheaper Lexus).  * iPhone integration is a joke.  In a 2015 model I received the connection to an iPhone 4!  When I asked where my iPhone 5 connector was, the dealership informed me I had to go to Apple to buy the adapter.  Are you kidding me, Audi?  If you connect your iPhone via Bluetooth, you can only select your songs on the Audi display SEQUENTIALLY.  So if you have 3000 songs, you literally have to scroll through each song to get to the one you want.  They give you an Audi app for media, but it was not reliable. Best thing to do is just to hard connect, but you have to turn off Bluetooth  audio, or it will fuss at you. * Navigation has a critical flaw.  Say you enter an address, it may prompt you to select (from about 5-7) a zip code.  If you are unsure, you pick one and if it's the wrong one, you are informed that address doesn't exist.  Why in the world would the option to select a zip code to a non-existent address be available, in the first place? There is also a feature to vocalize (input) the address.  The button to activate this feature never worked reliably.  * Computer processing power is sub-par.  You'd think Audi would just step it up a notch and put in a better processor to speed up execution of commands.  It takes forever for your system to initialize.  Say you want to turn on Satellite radio, it may take up to 10 seconds (from when you start the car)... not so on my Lexus. * Seating is not great for road trips.  I was spoiled with my last BMW because I had the comfort seats.  The A6 (2015 version) didn't have this option available (I heard they added it in 2016, but have not verified and don't know just how comfortable it is for long  hauls).  On a few trips to Austin and Dallas (from Houston), I found myself constantly shifting from side to side because the seating was just not comfortable.  My wife (5'4"" 112 lbs) had similar complaints.  * Steering still didn't feel as tight as my last BMW550 and, understandably (because the 550 was more powerful) the acceleration was not what I was accustomed to, either.  * Air recycle always turned off by itself.  It will not let you select the option to recycle and stay in this mode.  * No USB to add music to the Jukebox.  You can only do this using a CD, DVD, or memory card. * Transmission/gear issues.  During slow (parking lot) speeds the car would occasionally jerk forward as if a gear was slipping or something. I ignored it at first, but my passenger would always say ""Is there something wrong with your car"".  Long  story short, I had the car for two years (on a three year lease) and put about 10K miles on it.  I sold it and didn't mind paying for negative equity.  This experience, along with my poor experience with Audi Central of Houston, I will likely not purchase another Audi.",3,2015," Audi A6 Sedan 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

The A6 is an absolutely wonderful car, but it costs a lot too - especially if you opt for the V6 and some upgrades.  In the end, you do get what you pay for, so I settled on four stars, as the car is not a bargain by any means as was my 1999 A4 and 2007 A6 (both Quattro's and V6's).  Had I not owned the aforementioned vehicles, I would never have ponied up $55-60k for this or another upscale sedan.  But eight years with each previous Audi was enough to keep me coming back for more, even if I did vow to never again buy another one if the rate of inflation stays on course as it did between 2007 and this one.  Putting financial matters aside, let's talk about what makes it worth the price for me.   Aside from how solid the car feels inside and out, top to bottom, and aside from the top-notch technological features, I flat-out love the way this car performs in every mode of driving.  I run 50 miles per day on twisty backroads in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and this car makes every mile a pleasant one.  Whether I am in the mood for some spirited driving or just relaxed cruising, the smoothness and grace with which this automobile takes these roads is little short of astonishing.   It is silly-quick, handles like a sports car, and in true Audi form does it smoothly as silk.   I do not advise anyone pay for the ""sport package"", as this one handles as well or better than did the 2007 A6 WITH a sport pkg.  Bottom line:  Even tho the car is quite attractive and had luxury appointments and technology aplenty, it still manages to give the driver a superb driving experience, which to me is priority #1.  My only complaint is that the German carmakers who had always prided themselves on providing drivers with the best road-feel on planet earth have all gone with the electronic steering which takes so much of that feel away from the driver.  I guess we have to chalk that one up to ""progress"".  Interior appointments, as all have stated, are excellent, and the superb paint and bodywork will probably outlast all the mechanical components.  If there was one nicety I would put in the must-have list, it would be the Bose stereo system.  An automobile this good does not deserve to have lousy audio.  If you want a sedan that pampers you while also understanding you actively appreciate an excellent driving experience, look no further.

It was my daily driver for 2 1/2 years and my 35 minute commute (mostly curvy country back roads) was comfortable and the diesel had plenty of ""umph"" for passing.  It has shift paddles but I never use them as the tranny seems to work fine and I still am not ""in tune"" with the characteristics of the diesel so I let the tranny do the shifting.  I have taken it on three long road trips, each about 600 miles each way, and it is fantastic.  Over 40 mpg at 70 mph with a nice stereo, awesomely comfortable seats, and an efficient cruise control (as an older base car it doesn't have adaptive cruise control).  GPS is great and has voice control that works fine.  We got the prestige with most of the bells and whistles (how did we live without heads up display??)  The diesel-gate hit the fan a few months after we bought it but it never bothered me.  We just had the fix done about a month ago and it seems to drive the same but mpg seems reduced a few percent.  We already received our Audi settlement payment but not the Bosch one yet.   Anyway, six months ago we sold my wife's SUF and bought a truck to pull a trailer so I've been driving the F150 and she's driving the Audi.  I only drive it occasionally and today was such a day; I'm re-impressed with this car every time I drive it.  I can't imagine that aside from size (and this has plenty of rear-seat and trunk room) an A8 can be any better.  Thoughtful touches like the grocery bag hooks in the trunk are great.  The interior (we got the open pore wood with a light tan leather) is still attractive and it is my first car with cooled seats, which are great in the summer (and for my hot-flashing wife!!).  Anyway, can't say enough about it.  Rockville Audi has been great (we had a BMW but the service at the local dealer was horrible).  Last thing; I have managed to find what for me is the most perfect seating position in any car I've owned.  I have a relatively short body compared to legs/arms but it is fully adjustable and the seat bottom tips back a bit to keep the thighs supported.  Love it!

Two years and 26,000 miles later, I have yet to experience any mechanical failing. It drives great, its MMI system is intuitive and easy to use once you spend a bit of time with it, the car handles and drives exceedingly well, especially for long trips. Very comfortable, with only getting in and out a slight challenge for older folks as it sits low. Some have complained that the 2.0 turbo with CVT lags in performance. I've found it adequate in drive mode with regular gas, giving an excellent 31 MPG on the highway and about 26-27 around town. When rapid acceleration is required, a flick into the Sport mode provides plenty of acceleration. It really is like having two separate engines as it changes the shift points. You'll lose a couple miles per gallon though.In sum, the design, exterior and interior quality, and ride and handling are all very good. The criticism would be the braking, which although decent isn't quite up to the ride and handling of the rest of the car.  I've changed the oil 3 times at 8-10K miles, and haven't yet been down a full half quart. Audi service, though I've only needed standard maintenance to this point, though very good is not cheap. When I had to have the 4 plugs changed and the automatic transmission flushed and changed, the price quoted was--are you ready?--over $700! I took it to a good shop and got it done for $400.

Normal and under warranty so I didn't pay attention. Took it back in on October because i had had to put 2 quarts of oil through. Had an oil consumption study test done. Audi says oil consumption of 1qt every 1.5k miles is normal and not a problem. Fast forward to Apr 2017, CEL came back on, took to dealership and the same o2 sensor was bad again. they couldn't fix it then due to recall filling up their garage. One week later while driving i hit the breaks hard and the car warning lights came on saying that it was out of oil. had to put 1 quart of oil in it right away and took back to dealership. They said it was 1.5 quarts low meaning that my car was 2.5 quarts low without any oil level warnings going off. This car has no dipstick and the oil is electronically monitored. Raised hell about oil consumption and they finally dig a diagnostic. My oil sensor was dead. They replaced it. May 2017 driving to work lost power and the car was stuttering. Took the car to another dealership in scottsdale. 4th cylinder ring failure, only able to hold compression of 35psi, replacing the engine. 48k miles and 2 months out of factory warranty. Audi won't do anything about it...looks bad for them. I bought my wife a q5 from the same dealership after i bought my a6.

I had a poor impression of Audi in the past. When I drove the first one I was surprised how fast I found myself driving without even noticing, no noise, no fuss, just effortless acceleration. (previous car had 370 hp). Audi is a car you discover slowly. And the more you drive it, the more you enjoy it. I would start with complaints first: at this level, the car is missing some basic equipment found on much cheaper vehicles: rear cross traffic alert, Apple/Android Car Play. I think the windshield chips a bit too easy and so is the paint. The Bose sound system is good but not outstanding. My previous Genesis had a better sound(Lexicon). The electronics are somewhat fussy and distracting. But when it comes to driving pleasure and performance, this car is outstanding, it moves so fast with such ease, it's quiet, planted on the road like it is on rails. It has an intrinsic elegance and a remarkable presence.Update: almost a year later, I keep enjoying this car more and more. Long trips are a breeze. Passing other vehicles or merging on highway is super easy and fun. No malfunction. Bose sounds better after some adjustments. Audi added another year of free internet access. Comfort and quietness are excellent. Complaints: the screen that comes out of the dash is a gimmick, I worry the mechanism will brake in the future. Also the kill engine at stops is very annoying, this is what one of my first cars used to do, only it won't start when pressing the gas pedal.

First is the extremely annoying stop-start of the engine each time you stop the car for a traffic light, stop sign, heavy traffic, etc. You can turn off the feature if you remember to do so each time you get into the car, but you will often forget. Even with the feature turned off you can ""feel"" the engine thinking of turning off. I absolutely hate this feature and will not buy another vehicle with it. The second issue relates to the very low feature of the tires. There are only a few inches between the road and rim. I've had two blow outs because of the narrow space between road and rim. One blowout was from hitting a curb and another from a pot hole. Both situations would not have happened with regular height tires.

After nearly 2 years of ownership my only criticism would be that the transmission can be not as smooth as one would wish at times.

The ride might be a little firm for some, as ours has the sport suspension, but I enjoy the sharp steering and handling that comes with it.  One niggle is the placement of the HVAC controls.  They sit very low on the center stack and are difficult to see and adjust while driving.  Something used so frequently should be in a better location.  One option is to set the system to AUTO and forget about it - But at times things need to be tweaked.

Even after the first year and half, the car has all of the  exuberance of new car ownership.  All that has changed is that I ""know"" it and its capabilities and amenities better and driving out the driveway each morning is perhaps a little less thrilling and is now more of a long time, settled-in, best friend car-owner relationship.  I have only one issue, and that is at times the Audi connect service (which enables you to go into many of the internet options, including navigation points entered from your home computer) sometimes requires me to re-enter my PIN and is every now and then slower than I would like (but these are minor and few and far between occurrences.)  The only other thing that I have learned from time is that the front under-bumper spoiler IS LOW, and you have to be very careful about parking up against concrete parking stops.

I had NO IDEA of the stats for cars equipped with Diesel Engines. i.e. I didn't know they have a higher value, higher (MUCH) higher gas mileage.I enjoyed my '14 A6 - THAT MUCH, that I just went and traded that in for a new '16. (Faster MMI/Console MUCH better resolution on the screen - that ""techie"" list goes on and on, though I have to admit, it's the ""techie"" stuff that sells me.)One final note: (Added 7/20/16) I know the Audi A6 3.0 liter Diesel is one of ""those."" (VW Diesel Engine Scam?) Not only do I _REALLY_ not place much concern on that issue, but Audi is making GOOD on the deal. I've already received ""some"" compensation (without EVEN asking for it) and according to the news/media there's more, a LOT more, coming BACK into my wallet. So after reading that last note, you can certainly see that Audi is a company that is ""making good"" on THIS customer's experience.  Heck, and the car is even MORE 'techie' than my '14. Once you experience the safety Audi is building into these models using technology, you'll NEVER go back. It IS ""The Audi"" in my opinion that has the ""most"" bang for the buck when it comes to the built-in safety features of that car using technology. (Quick Example: Looking at the camera views when backing up, there is a portion of the screen that it APPEARS to be a camera that's sitting ~ 20 feet above the car so you can see ALL around the vehicle.) The ""Adaptive Cruise"" that will STOP YOU if you get too close to the car in front of you or the vehicle in front makes a sudden stop - your brakes WILL be applied and you will NOT hit the car in front of you. I assure you - there are 10's of other (safety) reasons Audi has built into this unit just not enough room here in this forum to share them all with you. There are just SO many other technical features built-into that vehicle and my writing I know cannot possibly do it enough justice. Bottom Line: I've owned MANY, practically a new one EACH year since '09 of higher value vehicles all 3 manufacturers come from Germany. Bar-None! If Audi keeps up doing what it's doing, I will have NOTHING but new Audis in my future purchasing plans for the next xx years.

Pros: THE best looking styling of all European/Japanese/American mid-size luxury sedans, hands down. Love the TDI diesel--44+mpg combined, quicker than a bullet, quiet engine (see the one major con on this engine below). Road handling is superb and this car is a blast to drive on a curvy highway. Cons--On the other hand...not the most comfy to drive on long trips and I have taken this car cross country. I get it's a sports sedan but after a while the lack of expected comfort starts to wear on you (esp. on a $60,000+ car). Tires--I have 30,000 miles on them, I don't drive hard, but the dealer told me I have about 10,000 miles left on them. What? 40,000 miles on a set of Dunlops? Biggest beef--as the tread wears down the noise these tires make is unbearably loud. Last issue-- Audi sends me a letter letting me know my TDI diesel engine was engineered to run on UP TO 5% biodiesel. Unfortunately I live in a state that mandates the sale of 20% biodiesel in the warmer months. Nice. Wish my dealer would have mentioned that to me when I bought the car. Audi goes on  to state in the letter to me that in any event, they WILL honor any warranty issues arising out of the use of this biodiesel. As one who usually ""buys them and drives them forever"",  I don't think I want to own this car after the warranty expires. I love this car but doubtful I will buy another diesel engine as long as I live in this state.

It drives and handles like a  dream. The technology can be a bit overwhelming at first but once you get used to how things work it is great. The controls and ergonomics of the cabin are almost perfect. Great quality materials in the buttons, high-quality diamond stitched Nappa leather and a sound system that is fantastic. Everything is arranged within the cabin with the driver as the focus of all controls and electronics. The virtual cockpit is incredible to use as is everything else. Engine response is superb with just a slight turbo lag in the low rpm range below 1300rpm. Once past that line, the acceleration is incredible. The handling is so balanced with acceleration and cornering that is way out of its class.

I am disappointed that mechanical problems have started. I rarely open the convertible top due to the hot climates in my area, however I have noticed there is unusual wear at all the fold points of the Root top fabric. In addition,I have noted some peeling paint Around the doorhandles. I brought this to the attention of the local Audi dealer and they refused to do anything about it claiming that it was not significant enough yet. I asked them what would be significant enough and they said we can’t tell you that. For a premium car, at a premium price, in a premium brand, that is just absolutely unacceptable in my opinion? I received a tutorial from a dealership in Charlotte North Carolina, not my own dealership, regarding enhancing the performance of the vehicle through the settings. This certainly did improve the acceleration and some of the performance, but I believe the car still feels more luxurious and smooth than sporty. It remains sluggish to rev up and acts like you are asking a lot to get up and run.  Not ready for a hot-lap on the track like the F-Type that feels like hopped up on espresso and biting it's nails to go everytime you start it. I still feel is not enough trunk space for a golf bag, couple tennis rackets fit fine. Handling is still very nice and crisp and the steering has a very connected tight feel that almost does what you think, very BMW-esque. Ride is still very quiet with almost no noise. Very tied down cabin.  I have found that the lack of a microphone and hands-free is really unsafe and cumbersome and a large disappointment...really??  My $30k Toyota Truck has voice command AND a touch Screen?! The Audi also lacks front parking sensors And with a nose that extends far beyond the front wheels, this is often a problem with curbs. Now, many of those complaints are relatively minor, compared to problems I’ve had with other vehicles. But the mediocre sports performance of the vehicle combined with its high price tag and the lack of support from my local dealership in this premium brand really leaves me disappointed about the vehicle. I would seek to trade in the vehicle, but I found out even a more for Disappointing fact. Despite the vehicle being somewhat rare and not very common, its resale value has plummeted since purchase.

I don't put a lot of mileage on my S5 but it has has no maintenance issues and is a delight to drive.  Finally, my son liked mine so much that he went out and bought an S5 coupe! There remains only one item I wish was different - there are no front parking assist sensors on the S5.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this is not standard or at least offered as an option as even A3 cabriolet has them. The color, Sepang Blue Pearl, is awesome and I constantly get compliments on it.  In addition, just as on our Q5, the paint job is FLAWLESS - not a touch of ""orange-peel"" anywhere.July 2016 Update:  Since we do most of our longer trips in the wife's 2013 Q5,  the S5 Cabriolet has just 12,100 miles to date.  The car has run flawlessly, looks showroom new and continues to draw admiring comments wherever I take it.  Worth noting - I cannot get a definitive answer on best tire pressure.  When I inflated them to the factory-recommended (sticker and owner's manual) pressure of 39/38psi the ride becomes a little too harsh for my liking.  I reduced the pressures to 36psi all around and the ride was better with no perceptible degradation in handing.  Also, I wish Audi would come up with a better composition for their brake pads - I bought a pressure washer to deal with the constant accumulation of black brake dust on my wheels - almost as bad as my old Bimmer.  I'm not at this point yet but when our Q5 said it needed brake pad replacement - Audi would not turn the rotors!  This strikes me as ridiculous and made a simple brake pad replacement job cost over $1,300.

The Audi S5 is that, and more!After test driving BMW, Audi, and Jaguar, I was on the fence between BMW and Audi.  The Audi just “felt” more fun to drive.  The BMW had a better entertainment system and better fuel economy.  Also, the Audi was slightly more expensive; telling me it had better resale.  The other thing that made me choose Audi was the Adaptive Cruise Control option.  BMW doesn’t have this option on many of their convertibles, and it was easier to find an Audi with one.  I am so glad I did!  What a great feature to have if you drive highways frequently.After 7 weeks with this car, it is more than perfect, if you can say that.  It is a high performance speed demon if you want, with a great exhaust sound and rally inspired handling.  If you want a leisurely cruise with the top down, you can have that too.  It does drink a little more gas than I was expecting, but the smiles per mile more than make up for it.  Traction hasn’t been an issue, and I can’t wait to try it in snow.The main issues I’ve had are with the entertainment system.  The Homelink garage door opener has not worked a few times. (I literally jumped in the OTHER car I have with it, pushed the button, and door went down on the first try.  After returning home, the Audi Homelink worked fine.) The “MMI” Nav screen has become “stuck” on a screen before after using the reverse camera.  I had to push the Media or Nav button to get it un-stuck, so not too bad of an issue.  One morning after putting the top down, a window kept going to 25% closed while the rest were 100%.  I had to manually use the window button on that door to get it to stay up.  The cord to connect your phone or iPod to the Nav system is a pain, as it is in the glove box.  Instead, I bought a 16GB SD card for $10 on Amazon and play all my music that way with one of two SD slots.  The Bluetooth for answering calls and playing music is flawless, however.  I very much prefer the non-touch screen in the Audi vs the touch screen in the BMW.   UPDATE: I have not had any issues with any of these systems since the dealer updated the MMI 6 months ago.Driving with the top up, it feels like a normal car.  The road noise can be elevated at times, which is because it is a cloth top.  A Mustang driver rode in my car and noted that the road noise was much less than theirs.  The AC cools very fast, creating a cool atmosphere on a hot day (95F) with the setting at 76F.  The ventilated seats cool quite quickly, but I am beginning to think they are more of a gimmick than worth the extra money.If you are buying strictly for performance, you might be a little disappointed with the vehicle stability and throttle response.  You can feel a lot of vehicle sway when cornering on a rough road, and many people install a rigid bar across the engine bay to reduce body sway.  The throttle is not responsive unless in sport mode, which is quite punchy and hurts drivability a bit.In addition, the looks of this car are unique and stylish.  Not too aggressive or over the top, but smooth lines and well-designed features.  Even with the release of the redesigned 2018 model, this one doesn’t look out of date.Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive and look at.  You won’t be disappointed in buying, although maintenance is slightly more expensive when items fail, the reliability has been fantastic.  If you came to this page to find the perfect car, this is the ONE!UPDATE: After driving this car for 14 months, I like it even more.  I've put almost 32K miles on it with no mechanical issues.  Even changed the tires and it didn't need an alignment.  I think the performance is better than I originally thought.  Keeping the car in Dynamic mode helps the stability in cornering quite a bit.

The difference is remarkable, both in performance, as well as an overall graduation to nicer interior stylings, technology and engineering. With the beast 333 hp supercharged engine under the hood, the acceleration from a dead stop was palpable, if not downright enjoyable. Outer stylings will certainly turn heads, as the car jumps off the page demonstrating elegance with an understated sportiness, particularly with the hardtop coupe model.  The technology and dashboard layout can be both intimidating and frustrating, for example many controls are dash mounted, consequently, its important to learn where everything is prior to getting in it and spinning around town. Sadly, in my case, the vehicle has only 18,000 km on it over two years, and paint is flaking off in large 25cent size pieces from the rocker panels on both sides of the car (where you would expect the paint to never fall off). I have notified the dealer in Mississauga, Ontario in this case, who recommended I go to Audi Canada, since it was out of their hands. I have contacted Audi Canada about the issue and they are unwilling to do anything about it citing road damage. I live in the city, drive the car infrequently on paved roads only, and do not drive the car in winter (as I spend my time in the south).Quite frankly, I am surprised by Audi's reluctance to do anything about it, since I am a repeat buyer, which is prompting me to look elsewhere when I replace my car in another year or so. However, when I do drive the Audi S5, the flaking paint is a good advertisement for the poor quality paint Audi has put on my car and anyone who asks, I tell them the problem. Other than that, defer to my earlier comments about performance, and its highly recommended vehicle if you don't mind the paint falling off it.",5,2016," Audi S5 Coupe Premium Plus quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 6M)"

Come on now, before spending your hard earned money, didn't you do your homework? You complain that the seats aren't heated, and the GPS is not what you like. Really? I think it's one thing to have 'failed' experiences, like poor reliability or gas mileage, but if you wanted certain features, why did you buy the car? That all said, the A3 is a great compact car.

I owned it in an area with several feet of snow and even in the fwd version with factory tires she handled excellent. I honestly I had great experience and only got out of the car and did not purchase due to two things. The first was that I do not have children, and only rarely do my back seats get used. Well one day I went to open my back door and the handle fell off, this was at about 800 miles (got it with 15) on the vehicle. Since it was a lease I thought this would be an easy go in and get it fixed. Wrong. They tried charging me just to look at it - over $100 - and then said that the warranty on the vehicle would not cover this as it was wear and tear. I was in disbelief as I only had used the back door on that car a handful of times. After fighting the dealership and calling corporate, they agreed to at least look at it for free. It ended up being a very simple fix, and they didn't charge me - though the bill they almost gave me was for over $300. The second was simply a cost thing. The first oil change on her was over $350. I understand other things are checked and such, but honestly the cost of the one visit was as much as my payment.

I have been, and continue to be very happy with this car. I wanted a small luxury sedan that was nimble and easy for city parking and was very good in snow, as i live in a major city in the northeast. I needed something easy to park. I wanted something with a simple but well appointed interior. I'm not partial to the Japanese luxury brand interiors, as they have so much stuff everywhere. I like clean and simple. I liked that the display could retract into the dash and the interior would be very sparse. I also wanted something that was a bit agile. I came from a VW Golf manual transmission and most automatic transmissions were slow to respond ""off the line."" I wouldn't call this fast to respond off the line, but it was preferable to me above the other luxury brands I test drove. I compared this car to Audi A4, BMW 3 series, Mercedes C300, Lexus, Inifiniti and Acura. This suited my needs the best and was most comfortable for me. I am short and it is perfect for me. This would not be a good car for a family of people over 6ft. The car has been incredibly reliable. I have not had one single issue. This car handles great and is very agile. It is very responsive for my needs. The combined MPG over 18k miles is 24MPG. I drive a combo of sport and normal mode, and do a fair bit of stop and go commuting. most of the miles are commuting miles I'd guess. My only issue is I wish the cargo room were a little easier accessible from the boot through the rear seats. My VW had so much more usable cargo space, but in fairness it was a hatchback. The pass-through from the boot to the rear seats is small and prohibits getting much back there. In fairness, I knew this was the case when I bought the car and it is a minimal complaint. You're not going to fit any furniture in here, but you probably dont expect to. I wish there were still a hatch version of this available in the states. The standard features are great and I wouldn't add a thing. I had the cold weather package added and that was it.

I average a combined 30mpg and I am a spirited driver.  The engine in this car is phenomenal.  The acceleration is fantastic.  It's a real sleeper.  I doubt there are many other cars that have four doors and excellent fuel economy that can handle and drive as well as this car.  I'm 6'2"" and the driver's seat is adequate.  Be sure to purchase the upgraded seats, I did not and the passenger's seat controls are very difficult to use.  The passenger seat confuses every single person who enters my car, including those who have been in my car enough to know how to operate them.  There is a knob to lean the seat back and it is not easy to use.  For an extra $500 you can get power seats all around.  There are two things with this car that annoy me to no end.  At low speeds the transmission on my car clunks in and out of gear.  It's unsafe.  I've been on a slight hill and trying to get the car moving and it's started rolling down the hill in the opposite direction rather than engage D or R, nearly causing an accident.  I've had it to the dealer several times and they've reset the transmission computer, but the issue was never resolved and I am now out of warranty.  The cure is to give it more gas, and this is counter intuitive and not what you want to be doing when you're in a tight parking space or on a slight grade.  It truly is a safety issue and I don't like it at all.  The transmission on my car also doesn't shift that great.   The automatic transmission is nowhere near as good as the engine.   I've had several loaners and none have had the awful and dangerous clunking in and out of gear at low speed transmission issue my car has, and they seem to be smoother shifting as well.  My next major gripe is the sunroof.  Mine has been rattling since around 4,000 miles.  It took me a long time to determine where the rattling was coming from.  Once I found it, I took it to the dealer where they broke more parts and damaged my car.  I've taken my car to three dealers and all they've managed to do was break things and put dents, dirt and grease stains on my ceiling and lie to me and tell me don't come back.  I'm not making this up.  I tried in vain to get support from Audi USA, but they were not helpful either.  So I have a clunky, defective transmission and rattling sunroof and no support from Audi or the dealers.  My experience with the three Audi dealerships I've visited has been horrible.  I've owned two BMWs and two Mercedes and never had issues or outright lies from dealers like I have with Audi dealerships.  Due to this, I will likely not be buying any Audis in the future.  This is a conflicting review.  I absolutely LOVE driving the A3.  The engine, handling, ability to cruise in the snow, and the car's confidence in the rain combined with excellent fuel mileage offset the miserable transmission and horrible support from the dealers and Audi USA.  I really love this car, but It's a mixed bag for sure.  For the $$, I wasn't expecting annoying rattling and non existent dealer support starting at 4,000 miles.  It's a shame the dealers have been unable and unwilling to help me resolve my transmission and sunroof issues.  I will not to go back to the Audi dealers due to the horrible treatment and outright lying I experienced.  I will deal with these annoying problems until it's time for me to find a new car, which will likely not be an Audi despite my love of this car.  Audi USA, if you're reading this, I tried to contact you MANY MANY times about my experiences.

Very well cared for from my end car has 20k miles.  In 20k miles I have had car shut off on highway from overheating, dealer added antifreeze, but it was above minimum and I've never had a car just shut off.  dealer said drive it in.  next I've had multiple electrical problems,  says doesn't recognize key, then i walk away come back and it recognizes then problem goes away for weeks.  then brake light out signal comes up on dash, brake lights are functioning and on (took video of it) took to audi,,  says no engine code, would have to tear car down to look for a short!   so I wait to have them take care of it, and it doesn't do it for months,  intermittently it will occur.  just give it a day or two and it goes away.   then i was rear ended while stopped at light (8k damages and frame/uni needed pulled to straighten)  had audi shop do the work.. got the car back and it vibrates badly from 65-80mph.  take it to body shop, they send me to Sunnyside audi service in middleburg OH, dealer service says everything is straight and balanced and no problem with their work. but they can put new tires on and balance them for 1200.00,  i reply that the car didn't do this before accident, they say they don't know.  I exclaim that the tires on there have plenty of wear left as i have snow tires and the tires have less than a year of road use.  they can't tell me why they would shake then.  I ask for a guarantee that it would stop if replaced, can't give me a guarantee.  I call audi america and they send me back to dealer.  Its a run around shell game thats completely disappointing.   I am 100% sure that the car DID NOT do this before accident and even said if you replace them and it fixes it, i will pay for them,  if it doesn't then you figure out what is wrong. no luck...  so in my short experience as a first time audi owner I have only been given run around on a car with clear issues and horrible repair work (dealer even washed the car immediately after their repair shop did a paint job (you don't wash and wax a car with fresh paint until it cures- at least 20-30 days, sunny side audi should know this).  anyway, each department sends me back to the next with no guarantee.  I've had a rental car for a total of 2-3 weeks in year.  Ive not had any resolution.  I will come back and post  a VIN if anyone purchases this vehicle and has problems which aren't disclosed at purchase,  audi america is aware, dealership is aware and you should get an attorney.  if you get this lemon, post a reply on my post and i will get back to you with an email/give you records of incidents so you may use them for recompense.  PS i asked repair shop to make sure carfax is aware, they say they don't report.  nationwide insurance company couldn't give me an answer if they would report the 8k.  caveat emptor but i hope whoever buys this and has problems finds this post.  JUST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, run around.  but alot of apologies, i.e.    ""we care, we can send you back to"".  I've owned toyota, honda, ford and acura where the buck stops at dealer if any problems.   acura replaced an  600.00 engine part under extended warranty and 2 years after ( no longer in warranty) the same part had an issue,  acura fixed it free of charge under good faith that it was a bad part.

I bought the most tricked out model with driver assist, auto braking, etc/. No one -- I repeat -- no one does driver friendly technology the way Audi does. It's one of the reasons I love the brand. Every time I drive my husband's Mercedes, I cringe at having to deal with an illogical navigation system.  I love the car's handling with the exception that it can be a bit trickier than my A4 on curves - perhaps because of the more narrow wheel base. The reason I say that a little more testing with women drivers would have been helpful is because the car lacks a couple of features that a woman will notice. Unlike my A4, the A3 does not have the automatic seat settings so every time I get in the car after having it valet parked, I inevitably have to move the seat back in position. But the thing that drives me absolutely nuts is that the A3 offers ONLY the options of having a driver's door open with the keyless OR all 4 doors. Gentleman - what exactly do you think a lady does with her larger size handbag? Hint: we do not hike it over the console!!!! We put it in the back seat, which means that you should have offered the setting to open only the two doors on the driver's side or allow the doors to open independently. Now, I have no choice but to use the 4-door setting, which makes me more vulnerable to things like carjacking when I get in my car in a parking garage.",4,2015," Audi A3 Sedan 1.8 TFSI Premium Plus 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl Turbo 6AM)"

The handling is sporty, steering seems tighter than the A4, and the car rides just as well as its larger cousin. The engine is quiet and smooth but there seems to be more road noise than the A4, probably due to less sound insulation. Mileage has been impressive, quite a bit better than the A4.

One visit was never recorded with Audi after 7 days of trying to trouble shoot and duplicate the leaking, which they never did get to leak....supposedly.  Took it in twice to a dealer with it physically  and they still said I was imagining things.  REALLY DISAPPOINTING AND VERY FRUSTRATING after I had such high expectations of buying a luxury European car such as Audi AND FOR THE PRICE.  The convertible button is located on the lower console but my puppy (45 pounds) steps on it, it starts rolling up.  One other time he stepped on the power button and the doors locked with my key fob sitting on my seat, he stepped on the lock button on the key fob....glad the windows were down partially and I could reach my key.  Lesson learned there and really pretty stupid of me to leave my puppy in the car to talk to the mailman, but thought they might make it a bit harder than that to lock yourself out.  Surprised the key fob isn't deactivated if detected in the car. Pinch protection on the windows was not working, one day I went to my car after it poured rain for 3 hours and drivers window was down 1/3 of the way and the interior door, seat and floor were soaked. This happened with the passenger rear window as well.  The Audi connect never stayed connected, had to go through a big process every time I tried to use it and log in again and again, with a pin and other annoying login criteria, it was only a 3 month trial.  After that you pay $500/year for the service and as far as I could tell, you only received a satellite image of the navigation, which for that price I am ok with 3D. Navigation seems really outdated even with the most current version....supposedly.  The one thing good about my car is the ride.  I do enjoy the handling and peppy pick up, VERY SLOW acceleration which they say because it has a clutch system, which I thought would be instant. Probably should have saved myself $20k and bought a Beetle convertible - same options and details since they are made by the same company. The convertible is lumpy and creases easily.  Large amount of road noise which I believe is associated with the top leaking since it is not sealing properly.  The Quattro is very nice in the winter. Glitchy annoyances like after closing convertible it turns my heater on full blast and it's 90 degrees out. If you switch from radio screen to navigation it goes to radio stations in the area not the presets that it was on so you have to switch back and hit the preset button again.

I was leery about getting another VW product after being burned with issues galore by two late 90's-era Jettas and my 2004 Passat, but that was a long time ago and I had recently read that Audi reliability was #3 or #4 out of all brands, so I took a leap o' faith. It's been a month, and so far, I have been VERY impressed. I actually have the 1.8T with the Premium Plus package, and it has everything I could ever want-heated seats, Nav (which comes with a free 6 month subscription to AT&T that turns the car into a rolling hotspot and links the Nav up to Google Earth-which is pure awesomeness), Dual Climate AC, and the best part of all-the Bang & Olufsen stereo-which truly is ""banging'"". I had the Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade in my 328, and I didn't think it was possible-but the B & O system is way better! Thus far everything is working as it should-no interior lights have burned out nor interior trim pieces have broken off, a la my previous VW's.I recently broke the car in on a Cannonball run to West Texas-6 hours in the car and the seats still felt comfortable. The car is rock-steady at 90-100 MPH, and passing power is more than ample.  My only complaints are sometimes there is excessive road noise (dependent on the road surface, of course)-but I believe this is due to the lower-profile optional 18-inch 10 spokes that I have on my car. Also, due to these tires, you can feel more imperfections in the road, and I don't like the way the brakes feel when braking with these tires, either.The car is small, but it's designed to be a small car so I'm really surprised when people say the trunk space and backseat are inadequate. Duh. I have no kids so it's a perfect size-my BMW was actually too big for my preferences. The gas tank is relatively small, so I find myself filling up more only due to its size (I think 12 or 13 gallons max) and not due to bad fuel economy-in the traffic hell that is Austin I still average 28 MPG.

It was a terrible purchase, even at a price I thought was great. It was leaking coolant the third day home, and required over $5k in repairs the first year. It was out of warranty, buyer beware, etc. I still like the car. It is expensive to fix, but when it is good, it is really good. Nothing cruises at highway speeds like a German car. Plenty of power, even on a high mileage engine. One thing I learned during the first year of ownership is this: don't take it to a dealership for service, period. You will overpay, in a ridiculous way. Example: bent rim, new wheel: $825. Really. I bought four new wheels and tires on tirerack.com for a hundred more than that, and they were lighter rims, and look better. That is just one example. The best thing you can do is learn to do your own maintenance/repairs and be vigilant. Read the online forums and watch the youtube tutorials. You will have to buy all new tools with a german car though. It is nothing like an American or Japanese car, which I have previously owned. Lots of starbolt fasteners. Even the wheels are held on by lugbolts (17mm) instead of lugnuts, which freaked me out the first time I rotated the tires. Most used car ownership experiences have a few repairs involved, especially once you break six figures on the odometer. For an Audi/Volkswagen, the parts are expensive and the service at the dealership is outrageous. I suppose I knew that going in, but that first year was rough.The interior is holding up pretty well and it looks like a much newer car than it is. The front seats are supportive and comfortable even on long road trips. The leather has held up well with a minimum amount of creasing and no cracks. The seatback on the passenger side did randomly detach at one point, but I was able to fix it with a pair of pliers and some glue. The navigation system is one of the least user friendly I have ever used, with a very cumbersome amount of effort to program a destination. It works fine once you get it programmed I guess, but I just navigate on my phone to avoid the headache. The bluetooth is easy to program at least, but it doesn't stream audio to the radio. The system does have an input for an aux cord though, and my wife likes the satellite radio. The sound is great.The performance is the best part about the car. It is a GTI in a fancy suit. Plenty of power to keep the driver entertained and with the S-line sport package you get great steering feel and confidence during cornering. Under aggressive acceleration I get a lot of wheel slip, which is the only gripe I have. Even with grippy summer tires, you have to baby the throttle a little bit. Most drivers probably aren't as lead footed as I am though, so it may not be an issue for most. The transmission is as high end as I have ever driven (manual), with smooth clutch engagement and a shifter that slides into gear like a hot knife through butter - so smooth. It feels very refined, but is every bit the sport hatchback when you want to play.The exterior of the car has also held up very well. The paint is still glossy like new. The styling on this car was well ahead of its time, and it doesn't look even a little dated. My wife fell in love with it because of the looks, and she hates hatchbacks. I get compliments on it all the time.You take the good with the bad. The Audi has been a bittersweet ownership experience.

After a while you get used to it and if you are patient enough to wait 3 seconds it wont happen. I was really surprise that nobody reported this issue on the previous reviews.

The ride is quiet, sufficiently powerful and ""luxury smooth."" The standard leather seats are very comfortable. The inside is laid out thoughtfully and everything is accessed conveniently. Car is quite handsome with top up or down and the convertible top is incredibly easy to operate in all respects. The Audi 3 seems to have all the latest technology---as much as I could possibly need and deal with. The ability to leave my iPod home and enjoy all my music from a custom-loaded, tiny sound card is just one of the many very nice little extras I discovered after buying this car.The windscreen is a great standard feature that is remarkably effective in minimizing the wind inside the cabin---wife thankfully no longer needs to put the windows up when the top is down in order to protect her hairdo. Only oddity is that power seats are not available at any price---no problem for us, though, since I am pretty much the only driver. The car is a bit pricey but the quality seems to be there and I've learned that you get only what you pay for. Thus, I'm confident this A3 cabriolet will be a durable and reliable car for us for many years to come. It is truly a pleasure to drive and I'm quite proud to be seen in it.     Twenty Months Post Purchase: I’ve now owned this car for about 20 months and my opinion, above, is confirmed by my 20 months of ownership. One caveat to my opinion: My Audi is stored throughout the winter months. Therefore, my experience is based upon May through November driving, only. I can’t comment on winter performance.       Also, the complementary service included with the purchase of this car is minimal, at least when I purchased it. Only the first oil change is complementary and prices for everything at Audi are quite steep, as they are with most Euro luxury brands.      Nevertheless, all things considered, I’d buy this car again and continue to be very proud of it and pleased with it.      Updating today, 7/2/2018, after two years and a few months of ownership. I store the car in winter and drive sparingly in summer. Thus, barely 5,000 miles on odometer. That said, no problems at all. Still enjoying the car very much. Totally reliable. Learning of its oddities, like when you drop the top, the windows automatically go up, not down! When you play music from the SD card, you have re-check the shuffle option every time you turn the engine off and re-start. You have to spend money to change the brake fluid after two years, even though you have only 4500 miles on the car? Other than such oddities, I'm perfectly pleased with the car and plan to keep it either until things begin to act up or the styling changes significantly. Rumor has it that this A3 cabriolet model and the A5 cabriolet will soon be discontinued and a new A4 convertible will replace both of them. My guess is that if this happens at all, it won't be for at least a few years. Then, I'll probably get the new model.

When I bought this car I was so excited since it was beautiful and such a great deal. However, as sad as I am to admit it, the car has some major flaws. You wouldn't think there'd be blind spots in this car, but they're extremely dangerous. They designed the side mirrors to look sleek and sporty, but they're so small you can't see much at all. I had to purchase stick-on blind spot mirrors in order to be able to switch lanes. Anyone that drives my car has the same complaint. Also, the wipers don't go hardly fast enough in the rain. There's been times I've had to pull over because I couldn't see in a normal rainstorm. I never had this problem with my past Audis. Also, within the first year it broke down three times and had to go back to Audi to be fixed. The turbo leaked into the engine, a pipe started disintegrating, and a spark plug clogged - all within the first year. I leased the car so Audi fixed it for free but the fact that these many problems occurred when the car was brand new was extremely concerning. Otherwise the car does drive very well and gets decent mpg. I drive mostly highway to work each day and the mpg is from 30-33. The entertainment system and climate control are also great.

That one car is my 2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro with DSG. I have gone from (in order of ownership) 87 BMW 325iC to 99 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro to 02 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro to 05 Audi S4 Cabrio to 08 BMW Z4 Coupe (Sunday car) and 08 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro DSG (everyday car), owning the last two the same time. I was a bit torn deciding between the Z4 and A3 before I moved to Chicago. I decided I just need one car so I had to sell one of the two. Needless to say, I sold the Z4 and decided to keep the A3. Sure the Z4 was sexier, faster, and just had more prestige maybe for the lack of a better word, but overall, I simply thought the A3 was just the car to keep. I am glad I did. I didn't want to regret giving up the A3 again. Rewind back to 2009, I actually owned a 2007 A3 3.2 Quattro DSG in 2007. After two years, Audi offered to buy it back from me, so I did sell it to Audi. It was a mistake because I really missed that car shortly after. And in the U.S. production stopped that year. So I went looking for another but none available -- not the A3 3.2 Quattro. So for some time I had the 08 BMW and I got myself a Subaru Tribeca as my everyday car. By chance I went looking for another A3 again in 2012 and found my now 08 Audi A3. Hallelujah!This Audi A3 is pure joy to drive. I have gotten out -- without digging around the car first -- of 19 inches of snow here in Chicago in the Blizzard of Super Bowl 2015; I have taken corners in this car that I probably would not dare take in any other car; I have gone up a circular freeway on-ramp at high speed enough to scare (and impress) my friend while he hung on for dear life to the ""Oh Sh!+"" handle; I have passed many cars on an uphill climb without the engine gasping for air. And what's another thing that makes this car such a delight to drive? It's that buttery and silky smooth dual sequential gearbox (DSG). Whether I'm driving in automatic mode, or sport mode, or manual with the option to switch gears with the stick or paddle shifters, the double-clutch transmission is so silky smooth and quick shifting up and down. Of course, when down shifting it may not feel smooth as the engine will roar down-shifting at high speed, but that engine sound sure is music to my ears.I know there are other cars that can outperform this car out there. But for the what I get out of this 5-door hatchback -- 250 HP, 255-lb torque, DSG transmission, just to name a few -- there's no other car out there for me. I can now and honestly say, ""I love this car!""",5,2008," Audi A3 Wagon 3.2 quattro 4dr Wagon AWD (3.2L 6cyl 6A)"

I hated to trade it but decided I wanted all the technology and driver assist offered in the newer models.  Waited through the periods of no gas sport backs imported into the US, then the ""clean"" diesel debacle, then waited to see how the e-tron worked out.  It's a 10.  Admittedly I had to get used to the fact that the 1.4 is a very different drive than my old 3.2.  That engine was amazing, but in truth it was a way more powerful car than I really needed or used, although the drive was great fun, but the nav was a CD that only knew the roads up to 2008.  (a CD!)  I've had the e-tron (Prestige trim) for 6 months, love it.  Got the Bosch charger for the garage and total charge in 2 hours.  My electric bill is unchanged.  My mileage is far better than advertised. I consistently get close to 30 mpg on the charge, and even when I use both gas and electric I get 75 mpg in normal conditions, and over 50 even in stop and go nightmare traffic.  Admittedly, I am a pretty chill driver, but I deal with LA traffic periodically and still get great mileage.  The comfort is great - the backseat is a little tight for long distances but totally adequate for around town.  And the back is as luxury as the front.  Another improvement is that the closed moon roof filters more light than it did in my old 2008, which in southern California is a good thing. The versatility of the A3 is what sells me - the hatchback turns the small car into a truck - pop down the back seats and the cargo space is amazing - I can fit bikes, furniture, large cartons, just about anything in there.  For groceries etc the cargo space without pushing down the seats is more than adequate.",5,2018," Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Prestige 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM)"

Then I test drove all of them (couple of times!) Let me tell you this, you can’t get all the features on any car unless you have something custom built for you. But after balancing it all and look at all the pros and cons, e-tron was the logical choice. I have driven it few days now and I love it. Coming from an i3 I was worried that I would be sitting lower to the ground. No problem. The car has so many great qualities that I quickly forgot about sitting low. Electric range is lower than i3. If you need more electric range, you should look at Honda Clarity Plug in or i3 REX. Small compartments could get a revisit as there are not many. Was that the deciding factor? Not really. The other thing: if you want Navigation the price jumps by about 7000 as it only comes in expensive packages. I chose to go without Navi and enjoy the craftsmanship Audi has done on the car.

The tires are wearing quicker than I would have expected (Contiental EcoPro?) but other than that no issues. Charging cable issue went away, and dealer can't duplicate the minor cold squeaking issue yet, but there are 20K miles of warranty left. Fuel economy was the same, just over 50mpg combined with 49% battery and 51% gas, we did several  long 11 hour drives. Looking at the resale value, it has dipped quite a bit for the 3rd year, which what Edmunds predicted, my guess it would increase (less depreciation)  as the price of gas goes up and people get rid of SUV's. Overall we are still satisfied with the car.Update January 2018Have owned the car 13 Months and it now has 17000 miles. The car is charged nightly and averages a little over 52 MPG overall with the the MMI indicating a little over 51% gas motor/49% electric motor. The car has two issues that need too be addressed in a service appointment next week. First the front end creaks and squeaks over bumps, especially noticeable when slow. Second, there is an issue with either the charging cable or the charging system as intermittently the car will only partially charge after being plugged in,  to about 1/2 charge. Overall, we still like the car and find it a good value, and cancelled out Tesla M3 reservation.Update  July 2017Have owned the car for 7 months and driven it 5500 miles. The car has been trouble free and the only warranty issue was the side assist computer was inoperative when I bought the car, and the dealer it fixed with no issue. With mixed driving and plugging in at home nightly and we are averaging over 60 mpg. On battery charge alone we average 18-20 miles.  I would not recommend purchasing a level 2 charger for you home as the Audi supplied charger completely recharges in 8 hours. We found a very nice aluminum wall mount that fits the Audi Charger perfectly for $100 on Etsy. We really like the car, especially the adaptive cruise control and lane assist warning. It's very quiet and comfortable. The audio system is first rate. (B&O). The navigation interface (MMI) takes some getting used to. The car had a 6 month trial for the Audi Connect, and I let it expire. The car never loaded the destinations properly from the phone app, and I can't see paying $10 plus a month for google maps. Hopefully with the next version of the software the app and interface will get better. We have a reservation for a Tesla Model 3, and this was to be the bridge car. Welike the Audi enough to consider not getting the Tesla.Original ReviewPurchased a used A3 e-Tron lease turn in a little over a month ago with 3300 miles. This is my first Audi. It is a very nice car, and so far a good value, especially since the used price reflects the first owners receiving federal and state tax credits. The car is very quiet, comfortable, handles well and efficient. I only have limited access to plug in charging, so I charge it about 3 times per week. With a full charge I normally get 13-17 miles on pure EV mode and in hybrid mode average about 41MPG. The last tank combining 4 plug in charges and a full tank, it averaged just over 51 mpg with mixed hwy (75%)/city (25%) driving. Its not the EPA advertised 83mpgE, but is what I expected based on the reviews I read. I agree as other reviewers have said, if your daily commute is over the pure EV range, just put it in hybrid mode to maximize your plug in charges. The ability to select charge mode at the end a long trip to use EV mode for city commuting, a feature that I heard was discontinued on the 2017 model is also a plus. I also like the clean simpleness of the interior layout and minimizing of buttons, especially the placement of the radio on/off/volume/track select button on the lower console. This car has the adaptive cruise control and pre collision braking, both which are awesome and worth the extra price! The items which I am not so impressed with are the B&O sound system and Audi Connect. The sound system is adequate, but lacks the bass response that my other vehicles have (Bose). The e-tron does not offer memory seats/mirrors which was disappointing since it was the highest Prestige trim level. I still cannot get the Audi Connect App to fully work after talking with the courteous and helpful Audi phone people twice. It wont push directions to the NAV and wont display all the Audi Connect features, nor remotely turn on the A/C. The Nav screen is adequate, but frustrating at times to use the wheel interface to input destinations. Since this car is new tech for VW/Audi, I would recommend purchasing the extended warranty and prepaid maintenance plans. Overall, I am satisfied with the car.",4,2016," Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Prestige 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM)"

This is similar to what I wrote on Yelp a couple of weeks ago. I'm giving this review 1 star because the car did not meet my mileage expectation for a plugin-hybrid car. I purchased my 2016 Audi A3 eTron around 6 months ago hoping that I can:  1. continue to be motivated to support our planet by going electric / hybrid; 2. get the best gas mileage (savings) with a powerful car; and, 3. get the carpool lane sticker. So given my first 2 goals, I thought that I ""upgraded"" when I changed my Toyota Prius to the Audi A3 eTron. I was totally misled by the advertising of this plug-in hybrid car. And now I'm beginning to think that I actually made a ""downgrade."" AUDI USA claims that the A3 eTron can run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. This number 83 was on the window sticker when I got the car. And the salesman also told me that the eTron can go 83 miles per gallon on gas + electric mode. First thing that came in my mind is the huge savings that I can get considering that my Hybrid Prius can only deliver around 48 miles per gallon (Toyota claims that the Prius can go 52 miles). Second thing that came in my skeptical mind is not to believe the advertising. So given my experience with my Prius, I thought that if AUDI USA would put a claim of 83 miles, maybe they really meant around 75 miles (given a 10% error on their estimate). But 75 miles per gallon is still huge savings. Third, if one of my objectives is to save money, then why consider buying a ""luxury"" or high end car. Why not just settle with a Prius? or a Volt? Just because I purchased a more expensive car does not mean I waive my rights to complain about its mileage. The advertising still says 83 miles. And so I purchased my AUDI A3 eTron at Audi San Diego in Miramar Road. Don't get me wrong. It is a great car. Its just that it cannot run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode as claimed by AUDI USA. Why? I'm still unclear about the explanation given to me by Audi San Diego (Valerie from their GM's Office). So I brought my car to the same dealership where I purchased it for service. I asked AUDI San Diego to test my car because I only can get around 45 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. YES! 45 miles not 83 miles not 75 miles! The biggest disconnect for me is that AUDI San Diego service department did not even know that the A3 eTron offers 83 miles per gallon mileage. The sales department is just beside their service department. Perhaps the eTron is still new. The service department said that if I only get around 45 miles per gallon, maybe its because of my driving style and my usage (city/highway/etc). Given I'm the worst driver in the world, my mileage should not be half of what the car claims that it can do. And so I left my car to the dealership so they can test it. And they reported to me that my car can go 44 miles per gallon and not 83 miles as being claimed on their advertising. Valerie from the office of the dealer's General Manager responded to my review at Yelp.com and explained to me that I should be happy with my mileage because based on the report that she got, the eTron should only be running 39 miles per gallon on hybrid mode and my car is running 45 mpg. What confused me is that she quoted and placed the link from plugincars.com. Why she used the explanation from plugincars.com got me confused. Is plugincars.com part of Audi? Does Audi has its own explanation for my concern? She also said that if I have further questions, contact Audi USA. OMG!

She's wanted a plug-in electric as she has driven hybrids since 2007. We looked at the e-tron and the Volt. She was impressed with the Volt but after driving the e-tron, she said there was no comparison. She has never stated that a car was fun to drive. She did after driving the Audi. To her a car is an appliance.  There is compromises with the e-tron particularly wit the range.  In our case my wife has a 5 mile commute to work.  The 16 miles of electric is sufficient. So far, she has ranged from a low of 16 miles, (90+ degrees out, AC running non-stop) to 23 miles (70 out, minimal AC). On a trip from our home in Hershey Pa to Charlottesville, VA we ran it on hybrid mode and got 42 mpg. Other than that road trip, she's not needed gas. It's been 4 weeks since we last filled it, driven 400 miles and it's still on Full. If the etron fits your needs - buy it! If you need more range, then the Volt is an excellent car too. In our case, with a short daily commute, the Audi is a perfect fit. With discounts, credits etc. we are in for $37k on the Audi versus $35k for the Volt. But we got power seats & moon roof for that difference in price.Update - We took a road trip from Hershey PA to Hackettstown, NJ.  Approx. 100 mi. each way.  We averaged 45 mpg running in Hybrid mode.  We've now learned all the nuances of the selectable driving modes.  For road trips, we put it in Hybrid mode to optimize the gas/electric mileage.  For the daily commute, she leaves it in the default EV (electric only) and runs without the gas engine.  Update 8 months of ownership - First off the gas engine's turbo blew at 3500 mi.  Not a good sign.  We've had it back awhile but since my wife uses it mostly on electroc it hasn't been truly tested.  As for the electric - it's great.  She goes 600-800 miles between gas fill ups due to her short work commutes. She's averaging 89.0 mpg! Great little car.  Now let's see.Great car that fits our needs perfectly!Update 18 months of ownership - the car has been perfect since the turbo issue.  It's extremel reliable gets great mileage.  My wife is up to 110 mpg since she can commute to work and back on electric.  The interior is still perfect.  The handling rock solid. My wife loves this car like none before it.

Handling, acceleration, and comfort are excellent, and I have averaged 82 mpg over the first two years of ownership.  I appreciate the car's simple, understated (non-dorky) appearance, which is something that seems hard to come by in the plug-in segment.  The A3 Etron wasn't cheap to buy, but has been relatively cheap to operate.  I buy a tank of gas every 4-6 weeks, and otherwise run around town on electric most of the time.  The $4,500 tax credit was very nice, also.

Yep.","This is my first Audi and first plugin. While there are some things that aren't perfect (I'm looking at you radio/climate system), overall this is a very pleasing car.Who buys this thing? Gas is cheap at the time of this review, so you don't buy an Audi plugin to save money, exactly. Who buys it then is someone who likes the handling and style of the Audi and is willing to pay a bit more for it, but still wants to do the environment a good turn. I doubt they'll sell a lot of these.Still, for me, this car fit the bill. And I'm overall quite pleased. I've had it 2 months and still have over half the original tank of gas in it. I'm averaging around 270 MPG. I do that by managing how I drive and making sure to arrange things to drive on electric as much as I can. This clearly is not something everyone will want to do. For shorter trips and my daily commute, I run all EV. For longer trips, I put it into hybrid mode from the start and let the car decide when to use the battery. Performance: hate to disappoint performance enthusiasts, but I've never floored the car. I bought it for a reason and I stick to that. I have hit it harder in EV mode when I pulled out and misjudged the distance of the car coming. It went to around 60% and I was frankly shocked at the acceleration. This is because when you're driving it 'normally,' it seems to be tuned so that it feels weak. But noooooo, noooo, it's not weak. Cornering-wise, this thing is beyond awesome, but that's coming from a guy who has driven non-Audis before. Hey, it helps my MPG to go around corners without braking, right?I have two main complaints, mainly with the controls. Why can't I switch radio stations without taking my eyes off the road? Seriously, there are like 18 radio controls and they all require me to look at one of two LCD displays. Sorry, but I miss being able to hit button #3 and know that I'll get a certain station. They un-invented that. Second, there seems to be no way to just let clean air vent into the car in the winter. For a plugin, this does make a difference. Using the heater costs me miles. When it's not THAT cold out, I'd rather just vent rather than have a choice between a) fogged windows and b) use my battery to get the vent temp up.If you're looking for a racecar, why are you even reading this? if you're looking for the best plugin hybrid, you should probably go see a Volt. But if you are looking for a way to do a good turn for the environment, to do it in style, and to have some pep when you want to let it loose, this car is worth a look. Is it a good value? Depends. Mine cost around $35K after the Fed rebate. This puts in territory of normal small luxury cars and normal plugin hybrids. I'm not sure I'm 'saving' money exactly with this car, but I am pleased I bought it.Update after a year and a half of ownership: I don't have anything major to change and still think it's a 4 star car. I found that by pulling some tricks and putting in some effort I can boost the mileage I get on electric. But that begs the question: why do I have to work harder to get the most out of my Audi? The reason, as far as I can tell, is that Audi sits in a performance mindset, and for them the electric motor is a way to boost performance, with mileage an afterthought. I mean, car has a sports mode that is easily accessible, but no eco mode at all. That's the main gripe, but overall it's a very versatile and economical car.",4,2016," Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Premium 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM)"

We traded in the infamous A3 TDI and own A4, A5 and TT.  Honestly, the TDI was a great car.  Too bad it was spewing so much pollution and worse, Audi lied about it by calling it ""clean"".  So now we have an etron.  Although mechanically, this car is great, the software, communications and electronics for the hybrid are so extraordinary poor, I would not recommend this car to anybody.  The benefit of a hybrid, is so you can hopefully reduce your operating cost.  Electric companies provide significant savings for people who can schedule their charging their cars at night and at work.  However, the software and communications for the car must work to make that happen.  Audi's software simply does not work.  Yes, they are aware of the problems.  Yes, they are working on it.  However, after 1.5 months, they still cannot get it working and they have no idea when it will be de-bugged.  Thus, the benefits of having a hybrid simply do not exist with this vehicle.  The other most dangerous problem, is that the RFID keys ""almost"" work.  The etron matches the VIN number to the key.  However, if they do not communicate perfectly, the instrument indicates that it does not recognize the key and wont start.  Unfortunately, it does not do it all of the time.  So we now must carry both sets until they figure out the problem.  Perhaps this car will be ready 2017 or so.  We are fans of Audi, but this car is not ready for Prime Time.

My previous car was a 2006 A3 Sportback, the first generation A3 in the US shores. This new car's driving dynamics is very similar to that car, which is a good thing. I do wish that Audi gave it a larger battery because driving in all electric EV mode in this car is very quiet and very satisfying. The 1.4 engine when it turns on is also quiet and more than capable. There were a few internet connection hiccups in the beginning with the e-tron connect service, but that eventually got sorted out.Update:With the warmer months approaching, I'm now able to consistently drive between 20-22 all electric miles (the on board computer usually reads 25-28 AER). The e-tron drives fantastic with just the electric motor. Audi made the right choice by giving it enough juice (85 kW) to pull away from traffic lights and freeway on-ramps on electric power alone. Selecting Hybrid Auto or Sport mode (Hybrid Hold), a driver has access to all 204 HP and 260 ft-lb of torque. One pedal driving with strong regeneration is possible with Sport mode or manual mode on the Tiptronic.e-tron connectivity service can sometimes hiccup.

Handling is good for a big heavy car.

"1030",2017-08-10,"Twowheelsgood","2018 Audi S4 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)","2018 vs 2010 Audi S4 Prestige","After much cross shopping, including the Mercedes C43 AMG, I ended up replacing my 2010 Audi S4 Prestige (7A) with a relatively loaded 2018 S4 (S- Sport and winter packages, 19"" wheels, Dynamic Steering). I've only had it for one week so this just my first impression, which is mixed. What's better in the 2018 S4: suspension (more compliant with no loss of grip); brakes (less grabby with no loss of stopping power); steering (still lacks feel but quicker and more accurate, particularly off center); front seat adjustability; instrument panel; parking & driver aids; headlights; fuel economy. What's better on the 2010 S4: exterior styling (except the lights); throttle response; transmission (DCT); difference in driving experience in different mode settings (comfort, auto, dynamic). It looks like the 2018 wins by a knockout but it doesn't. The new car is really let down by a tendency to bog on initial throttle application. It feels like some combination of poor transmission tuning, a very soft throttle tip-in setup, and some degree of turbo lag. It can be a party pooper and the car doesn't come alive in Dynamic mode they way the old one did. We'll see if the 2018 S4 grows in on over time. I've already discovered that using the paddle shifters helps with throttle response. I've already shifted this car ""manually"" in one week more than I did in the old S4 over seven years.  The  ZF 8-speed in the new S4 responds pretty quickly to the paddles but doesn't cope well with stacked downshift requests. I read that the terrific new 10-speed auto in high performance Chevies drops multiple gears in an instant.  More to follow once my new S4 passs the 1,000 mile break in period.Edmunds asked for an update, so here it is at 5,000 miles (February 2018).  I have warmed up to this car considerably. The performance is sneaky in that very potent acceleration, cornering and braking occur with so little fuss that it's easy to caught out going much faster than appreciated. It reminds me of riding my BMW S1000RR in that regard. What is really impressive is how well a car with this performance deals with slogging on the daily commute. When surrounded by other cars that limit enjoyment, I put the car in Auto or Comfort mode, set the dynamic cruise control (on secondary roads as well as highways) and let the car deal with it while I listen to the excellent B&O sound system.  When conditions and traffic permit, I switch to the Dynamic mode with or without manual shifting and go for it. The steering and handling are excellent and with the sport diff the car actually wants to rotate, which is a rarity in front-engine Audis. The issue of delayed downshifts and throttle response persist but these are largely eliminated when Dynamic and Manual are selected. I think my original disappointment with Dynamic mode was because I followed the recommendations for light throttle inputs during break-in. There is now a distinct difference between modes, Dynamic is very crisp but happily does not cause the ride to become too brittle or edgy. The only other irksome problem I've had so far is a weak HomeLink transmitter. I have to carry the remote in the car because the built-in unit often fails to open or close the garage door. I believe this is because they relocated the transmitter from under the front fascia in the B8 to somewhere in the back end of the car in the B9 version. Indeed, if the HomeLink doesn't get a response when I approach nose-in, I can turn the car around and present the back end to the garage and it will work. But that's tiresome so I keep the remote in the car. Seems a dumb fault in $65K luxury sedan. I had no such problem with by B8 S4 or with my '14 Audi Q5 TDI. So as you can see, I have warmed up considerably to this car and would strongly recommend it to any enthusiast who wants a 4-season sport sedan that copes equally well with felonious speeds and daily driving. Every time I get in the car I look forward to driving it and the interior, including the virtual cockpit. I have also been saved a few times now by Audi Pre-Sense, Lane Assist and Cross Traffic Assist, so the technology is excellent. At 5,000 miles there have been no mechanical issues with the car and it will easily get 24-25 mpg measured at the pump unless relentlessly flogged in which case it will be in the teens. One last point - when I bought the car I was told by an Audi service manager that the 18"" Audi OEM wheels I used for winter in my B8 S4 would fit the B9. Wrong! These wheels didn't clear the calipers of the new car so I had to buy aftermarket 18s to which I fitted Nokian Hakkas. Not the sportiest winter tire but absolutely the best in terms of stopping and going in snow.",5,2018," Audi S4 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

Coast to Coast! 2018 S4 Prestige","Coming from a 328i and being a BMW fan in general I was very skeptical, with high expectations, for the S4 and I felt like I was taking a risk when I purchased this car. Looking back, I honestly feel I could not have made a better decision. This car is simply amazing in every way. I recently drove this car coast to coast from New Jersey to San Diego and had plenty of time to break it in. Ride comfort: 40 hours and 2 1/2 days never went so fast... the Quattro handled torrential downpours to aggressive cornering like a dream. Fatigue was not an issue with the 3-way massaging seats! Driving Dynamics: The S4 accelerates like a rocket and handles like a dream at any speed. The different driving modes are critical as road conditions change. I loved how the Dynamic mode handled the winding mountains in the Southwest with ease and the comfort mode was smooth sailing through the various construction work zones across the country. Tech: The high end gizmos in the new Audi's was what finally pushed me away from BMW and towards Audi. The adjustable color heads up display with Navigation and speed sign recognition worked great! Crossing America, I never had to worry about the changes in the speed limit from a high of 75 to a low of 45 in the work zones... The cameras always caught the sign changes. I had never used lane keeping assist before so there was an adjustment period but once I got used to it... it was a blessing. After hours of driving and possible fatigue it felt like you had a guardian angel by your side giving you gentle nudges to keep you on track day or night. Having Navigation on dual screens is quite nice and extremely customizable, especially zoom in/out with the scroll of your thumb. The only negative I have is that the download speeds of the Audi Connect when searching weather or traffic updates was a bit slow but not surprising considering all the digital processing constantly going on with the car. Overall this car is a dream machine that I plan to enjoy for many years to come.",5,2018," Audi S4 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A)"

I've always driven sport/luxury cars including Volvo S60 R-Design, Infiniti G35 and G37 Sports and this is one of the best I've had. Crazy fast, the sound and kick in the pants is intoxicating when you bury your right foot and that supercharger kicks in. Interior is one of the nicest and infotainment/MMI is the best for ease of use. If you love music as I do you have to go for the B & O sound system. Two minor complaints; front brakes needed to be done at 22,000 miles and I must be getting old because the seats aren't as comfy after about 2 hours in the car. Up for a replacement this fall and the short list consists of the new Audi S5 Sportback, the Volvo S60 Polestar or the Lincoln MKZ with the 400 hp twin turbo. I know, it's North American but I will know once I have driven it.UPDATE. The car goes back at the end of October and I am going for the Lincoln MKZ with the twin turbo 400 hp AWD. I am impressed with the car, only reason for changing from Audi is the Lincoln is a bit bigger, a bit softer (bad back) and it's maybe just time for a change. I will miss the roar of the Audi when you put your foot into it but the 2018 Audi with the turbo instead of the supercharger is a bit more subdued anyway.UPDATE 3/12/18.

I am very impressed with my s4, thus far 1 unscheduled visit to the dealer to repair a leaking water pump (covered under warranty @46k miles).  I now have over 110k miles.  I went with a ""Stage 1"" software upgrade from Revo when the car hit 50k miles....best bang for the buck upgrade I've ever done.  333hp in stock form to 410hp and torque from 325 ft/lbs to 390 ft/lbs, not only did I get a lot more torque (which is noticeable when overtaking) but my mpg improved as well!  No other issues to report.  I am due to replace my OE clutch.  The ride is stiffer than in the past, I think the shocks are on their way out.  The interior has worn well, no tears on the seats and minimal stretch marks on the leather seats.  The navigation is a tad on the slow side (as others have mentioned).  The car is heavy though and I can definitely feel the heft when I track it.  Because of it's heft, the brakes get worked thoroughly....on the street, you won't notice any brake fade (just on the track).  Tire wear is even, perhaps due to the AWD system, you really don't need performance tires.  The s4 has impressive lateral grip. Fuel economy has dramatically improved from 23.1mpg when new to now I'm consistently getting almost 27mpg (mostly highway driving).  In the 110k history with my s4, I'm on my 4th set of tires (OE Continentals & 3 sets of Pilot Sports), on my 3rd pair of brakes (front), 2nd pair brakes (rear), and 1 headlight bulb replaced (right).

Let me just get the transmission issue out of the way right now.  I don't know why people would get an automatic in a car like the S4.  You're buying a Camry, Impala, or whatever, sure, go with an automatic, who cares, but an Audi with V6 supercharged engine?  The whole point of a car like the S4 is to have some fun, but then you get an automatic with it and you're saying, ""actually, I want to reduce the fun I have with this car.""  What?  Anyway, whatever, just my bias.         Okay, to the car itself -- what a marvelous vehicle.   I did a lot of research on cars in this range, test drove a few, and knew this was the one I wanted.  It took me nearly a year to find a used one in the right color (grey), black optic package (just for the wheels, don't care about extras), with the 6M, and the right price, but when I found it online, I jumped and bought it used with 12K miles and hope to keep it a long time.          Engine and transmission: fantastic, best transmission I've ever driven, engine sounds great, power is there all day long at whatever speed you want.    Spectacular.    Some people (mainly auto critics) complain about not enough ""feedback"" from the steering.  I don't know any better and the steering feels great to me.    This car sticks to the road.  I put Conti ExtremeContact DWS on a few months ago.  They are not quite as sticky as the summer tires that were on, but the very marginal loss of performance in turns is more than offset by the superb all weather capability.  With the Contis and quattro, I am ready for any ice and snow or rain.    Interior and exterior are beautiful, not flashy, very sophisticated.  That's what I wanted.  If you want to show off, get some attention, you may need to look at another car.    Tech:  these are my only nits.  As noted in reviews, the MMI control knob spins in a non-intuitive direction.  Why?  I have no idea.  The MMI interface is good, not great, but good.  Love the dash display, all the options.  Climate control is my least favorite feature.  It works, but it is too complicated, too many buttons.  I am still not 100% positive what I am ending up with when I make certain adjustments.  I can live with it.    The S4 comes with so many other helpful electronic features that I highly recommend you go through the manual page by page to make sure you are aware of them all.  (For example, you can set the passenger side mirror to tilt down when you back up.  Never would have known that.)   You can adjust suspension, engine sound, etc.   In sum, this is a wonderful car.  There are other possibilities in this price/performance range, but I can't imagine anyone ever regretting the S4.

I am very happy with my purchase. Love the quality and reliability, love the intelligence and absolutely love the speed and acceleration. No breakdowns whatsoever in 3.5 years and 56K miles.However maintenance cost is way too high if you don't do it yourself. I decided to do as much as possible myself (I like working on my cars) and after some initial investment in required tools my son and I already changed oil, breaks, disks, sparks plugs, filters, etc - everything strictly according to the maintenance schedule and AUDI torque specs.

We also had to buy a special cable to re-program the car, reset service reminder, etc. I actually love working on this AUDI, it is very well engineered and it is a pleasure to service it.There is one more thing to know / consider. You should not expect this car to be very economical fuel consumption-wise. It all depends how you drive it - you can get anywhere from 15 to 28 MPG on a highway.

Surprisingly, in less than a month, a sudden annoying beep, repeatedly announcing an Emergency Call Malfunction, terrified us.  After contacting Audi Service, they took the car on November 24th, 2017, and promised to fix it in a day or two, saying they know about 2018 Q7 car defect.  This comment rang a bell in our mind.  If they already know about it, why Audi sell it without fixing it?!  Is this a fair trade?!  After more than 20 days later, Audi did not fix the car.  Going back and forth, finally Audi’s Service Department told us that they could not fix the car, because a part was not received from Germany!  This was not just an irrational excuse; but, also, a gross insult to us for spending over sixty-seven thousand dollars on an Audi car, and receive such poor service!  Is this a fair trade?!  Anyhow, to solve this problem amicably, I told Audi’s Manager either to give us a full refund, or a new similar car.  The latter agreed to provide us a new similar car in a few days.  Alas, Audi did not fulfill its promise, again.  For the benefit of doubt, we gave Audi’s Manager a longer delay; saying we are travelling and will be back around mid- January.  By then, we expect you to give us a similar car, or a full refund.  Sadly, Audi did not fulfill its promise, for the third time.  By definition, a brand-new car means a defect-free car.  Hiding the 2018 Q7 car defect is an act of misleading and dishonesty.  This defect is known by Audi and its dealership since some time.  Yet, Audi did not tell us about it.  Thus, Audi deceived us in selling this car.  Plus, our 2018 Q7 car is considered a lemon car by Federal and State Law.Audi’s Dealership knows that I am a science major and must concentrate on my studies.  Audi wasted our time for three months for no legitimate reason; during which we were – and still are – paying installments, interest, and insurance on a car, which we are not using since last November; because it is in Audi’s possession.  Audi’s dealership has frustrated us, disappointed us, caused us to suffer, and denied us the enjoyment of using our own brand-new car.  By any standard, Audi’s transaction is – unethical and unfair.  Audi’s Director of Variable Operations offered us his apology for causing us this ordeal.  Does he really think that his apology shall alleviate our suffering?!  Based upon the aforesaid trouble, we find it very difficult for us to trust Audi anymore!  We honestly believe that if Audi and its dealership care about their name, business and reputation, they must cancel this deal as well as its loan, immediately; pay us a full refund of our money, including all interest, insurance, and installments we made.",1,2018," Audi Q7 SUV 2.0T Premium quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

The can of fix a flat and compressor, that is included in lieu of a spare, is only good for 1/4”, or smaller, puncture in the tread of the tire. The fix a flat goop is of no use on a side wall cut which is not an uncommon occurrence on an SUV especially one as capable off road as the Q7.  The run flat tires have a recommended driving range of 50 miles. As I frequently travel in Central Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming, often outside of phone coverage, anyone familiar with these areas is aware that 50 miles is an inconsequential distance in many parts of the West. However if I were to be fortunate enough to be within miles of say Beatty Nevada what are the chances of finding a tire there that I could not find in Denver?

I sometimes bump my knee against the dash when getting in. The seat can be adjusted, of course, but when you are in hurry (like when it's raining), I suspect you'd bump your knee. The dash and headlight controls could be pushed a little further in. Also, I sometimes hear some low level vibration in the rear door panels. I think it is more noticeable when my daughter puts her water bottle in the door pocket, but sturdier materials would probably help with the noise. Also the dash panel switches are brushed plastic type things. BMW uses more glossy materials which just look better. But the thing handles like a boss. The acceleration is pretty impressive, even for the 2.0 T. I switch between the Dynamic and Sport mode mostly and performance level change is incredible. Only had this for a month, so reliability questions are not applicable. The seats are spacious and comfortable. The 3rd row can seat average sized adults if needed. The trunk has plenty of space. The panorama roof if beautiful. The cabin lights, exterior lights, and assist lights are thoughtfully designed and soberly placed (not a glaring bright wash of harsh lights when you open the door). The cameras and console display are great. The LCD display on the dash is very useful and adjustable. And the handling! Yes, the handling! All in all, a winner.

The head Audi technician brought me a new, identical car to the one we leased, to test drive exactly where I frequent, and it was the same!

The car kept beeping every couple of minutes for 2 hours!  On our way home, it still kept beeping the whole duration of the trip (4 hours!).  But the worse part was when we took a detour to Barstow, CA for a short rest, the car just slammed the break by itself and made a hard stop at the freeway off-ramp, then a louder beep sounded off with indicator lights flashing.  It was a very dangerous occurrence.  It is fortunate that it was in an isolated road at that time.  Otherwise, it could have been a serious accident.  I filed another complaint and still no commitment from dealership on my request to replace it.  The car was picked up by dealer for series of checks and repairs (3 week duration).  I finally decided to start a legal remedy and this time Audi USA took me seriously.  I was offered to have a brand new replacement but I changed my mind already and demanded for full refund.  Took couple of months of negotiation.

Dealer decided to purchase the vehicle from us and being that the dealer steped-up to help us we decided to give it another try. Leased another 2017 AUDI q7 carbon gray metallic premium plus with warm weather package which meant higher payment and another down payment. Not even 24 hours into the new Q7 we had troubles with the supercharger. Should have known then it was not going to stop there. Center consoles get warped horrible design which leads into the terrible quality of the seats. we leased a Q7 with Warm weather package due to heated/ a/c seats hoping that these seats would wear better. NOPE front driver  seat 2nd row seat and 3rd row seats all need replacement. Drivre side front window needs window regulator slow roll down and noise.Drivers door has a pop sound which we have been trying to chase for 5 months. Have fun trying to close the doors 5x . Oh and don't forget squeaky brakes around 6-9k miles still no fix in site for that.  Ours for some odd reason has a rough idle and the other day just decided to start shaking and feeling like it wanted to accelerate while foot was on brake. YUP vehicle is at the dealer currently AUDI customer support/service no help and terrible  attitudes. Timing to get issues handled with AUDI is the worst. Being my first AUDI experience i would never ever do it again nor refer anyone to purchase or lease. I can only hope this review will save someone else a huge headache / loss of money!

Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We've since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+; some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off); the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won't hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the ""new"" rep - all the while I was calling their office and even asking Audi US office to help - I had to drive up to the dealership again. This time I asked for the sale manager and told him that I wanted an answer from him directly. This guy, their sale manager, PROMISED to my face, that he would definitely get back to me within a week, ""before next Friday""... Well, Fridays have come and gone and it's been more than a month yet not a single word from anyone at that dealership. Granted, those issues (e.g. missing key code) are mostly annoyance, not exactly life threatening. But you expect  certain service when you buy a $60,000+ car and want to have some trust in the dealership that they will take care of certain problems when needed. It's a shame because honestly we like the car, but the poor customer service has put a huge dent in our enthusiasm and adds a significant doubt as to how long we should hold on to this car.Update 8-2017: The experience with the service department at this dealership has been better than the sales side - yes I have been using their service despite the really bad experience with their sales because of the location and convenience. They are still not as responsive as I would expect when it comes to schedule appointments etc but they do get the job done on time once I get the car in and the folks at the service department are courteous and some of them even go out of their way to help.",4,2017," Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

I went for the adaptive chassis which gives the Q7 amazing road holding. This car is loaded with technology.  Audi should hold classes the way Apple does to familiarize the owner with everything this car is capable of doing. You have the ability to control all the cameras; that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360-degree views at will.  The driver's seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals; and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift; and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It's a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car's technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package. It has been a year,  and I do like this car.  I have figured out most of the tech and am just disappointed in the recurring monthly charge to keep maps and all up to date.  That runs twenty bucks a month. Given the sudden changes in weather we have been experiencing, I am pleased I am in a mobile mini-fortress. Even with all the safety features it is still worthwhile to remember no one can drive on ice.I have had the Q-7 for a while now and still enjoy its major benefits as drivability, acceleration, comfort, and safety. But front storage is still a problem that can't be fixed. The official Audi app is close to useless, and Audi should pull it from the market period.

Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350; making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don't mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20"" tires (Goodyear) that our Prestige has so you have to wonder how many tire shops within a 50 mile radius would have a replacement tire in the event of a tire failure.  I read horror stories about ROF tires, but ride quality, noise, and handling are not an issue in the Q7.  Due to all the technology there will be a very steep learning curve.",5,2017," Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"
"1164",2017-01-08,"TxAggie","2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)","Comfortable Luxury but not perfect.","Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn't in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21"") on shows two manufacturers (Goodyear & Continental) with a price per tire near $500.  The interior is very nice.  The one drawback is the lack of storage bins.  There are only two small bins.  The one under the arm rest will hold a pair of sunglasses but leaves only a little room for anything else.  The CD player is located in the glove box so if you want to play a CD you have to load it before you start driving.  The virtual cockpit allows you to do many things without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  Functions like the radio and phone can be selected and controlled on the steering wheel so you don't have to look to the side to make a call or change the radio station.  The blind spot warning lights are on the side mirrors cover and are easier to see than just a small emblem on the mirror.  The speed limit for most streets is displayed on the instrument panel and the heads up display.  You can set a reminder that will cause the posted speed limit to flash if you exceed it more than the amount you set.  A very nice reminder in residential areas.  It also lets you know if you are in a school zone although it will still flash as if you are speeding even when school is not in session.  My wife has a very hard time pulling straight into a parking spot.  The parking assist will display your position in the parking spot so if you are at an angle or taking up two spots you can see it before you exit the car.  This is a great car (a little pricey) if you know the small shortcomings.After 5000 miles I still enjoy driving the Q7.  I love the heads up display.  I won't buy another care without it.  It took a little while to learn to use the adaptive cruise control and I don't drive on the freeway anymore without using it.  It does have a few quirks though.  The set speed automatically adjusts downward with a decreased speed limit which is good but it sometimes reduces speed even though there is no change in the speed limit.  This is especially true if the road had a long term construction project.  The cameras will also occasionally miss an increase in the posted speed so the speed sign will flash until you pass another speed sign and this can be for many miles.  The camera doesn't recognize all the signs indicating the end of a school zone so it will also flash until you finally come across another speed limit sign.  There are a  couple of irritants.  The drivers door has developed a rattle when driving over a slightly rough road and the dealership hasn't been able to fix.   (I didn't have this rattle after 100k miles on my Lexus SUV.)  Also the steering wheel is slightly ""off"" level.  That is if I put the steering wheel ""level"" the car will move to the right and it this includes driving in a parking lot.  The dealer checked the alignment and said it is ok but it still does it.  The backup sensor is nice but when I have a bike rack in the trailer hitch the warning tone is constant when backing up so you don't get a sense about how close you are to objects behind you based on the tone.  The car computes the estimated miles remaining before the next fill up but it tends to over estimate the gas mileage so it can be up to 100 miles  less than indicated on the display.  It is more noticeable when driving long distances on an interstate highway.After 14000 miles I like the car.  I had to have the motor that controls the driver side mirror replaced.  This required resetting the cameras that are used in to indicate car position ( lane & parking) and it took all day.  They also looked at the door rattle.  They could hear it bout couldn’t find the source.  A manufacturer rep said it was the seals so they applied something to the seals.  The door still rattles.  The MMI connect which give you info about the car is now incorrectly telling me a window is open.  I had to make an appointment to get it fixed.  I just drove on a 4K mile trip.  It doesn’t get near the advertised mpg.  There is a screen that gives you the mpg for the trip nut it is off 3 to 4 mpg.  (Checked at every fill up.). The engine seems to burn small amount of oil.  Trailer hitch can’t be locked.",5,2017," Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions; as usual, the ""secret"" is to accelerate gradually.                        DRIVING EXPERIENCE: It is boring (Lexus RX 350 sort of feeling) in Auto mode. More exciting (BMW X5 sort of thing) in Dynamic mode. I was actually surprised by how agile and stable the car is going uphill at good speeds in Dynamic mode. A true Dr. Jeckyll  and Mr. Hide sort of personality.   The car is long, but parallel parking is actually easier than I was expecting. Mind you, I said easier and not easy. Without the rearview camera and at night in dark areas, it is not completely a ""piece of cake"". Driving uphill on serious pitches like in Old-Town San Diego was more pleasant that I hoped for. I was a tad concerned on some pitches when I had to come to a complete stop, but the car proved excellent.                                                                          NOISE: Wind noise in more than on the BMW X5, at least once I hit 80mph-ish.. Road noise is definitely low. Excellent in that sense.                                      INTERIORS It is well detailed, it not exceptionally luxurious, at least not in the Premium or Premium plus trims. Unfortunately, the Luxury package (another $6k) is available only in the Prestige trim.   The car is comfortable, but not exceptionally comfortable. I am 6'2"" and 245lbs, and on a 4 hour + driving I wished the car had a better support for my thighs . The seats feel comfortable, but after hours of driving, did not feel that comfy anymore.  The double shade panels in front are an excellent touch. I wonder why more cars do not have them since that is an inexpensive feature..                          INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions.  For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though).  The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking.  But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.

Great car with lots of updates in tech and safety. Comfortable and quiet. While the engine has the punch in 'dynamic' mode, it lacks in 'auto' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn't great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls. I have not been able to hit the manufacturer's gas mileage of 19 city/25 highway/21 combined. So far locally I am getting 15 mpg or less and 20 mpg on highways. This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet; curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I've been more critical than happy so far... I am just starting to get comfortable with the changes and hopefully it will get better over time. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle.

Any size concerns related to parking go away with the visual package and the 360 view. As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.10k update: Car keeps driving great and fuel economy got to 21.5 miles/gal. Two minor issues: climate control cannot be synch-ed from the driver controls, you have to manually do it. You have to look at the temperature in the second row as well. Not ideal for a car of this price. One of the speakers will have to be changed as it has a raspy sound in some specific range. It will be covered under the warranty. All things considered, still very happy. Pleasure to drive.20k update. Very pleased with the car. All works as expected. Pleasure to drive. I bounce between the auto and comfort drive mode. Fuel economy a little above 22 mpg now. I extended the satellite radio service. I have not extended the Audi google map and news service, I think that it is too expensive and they should offer a more competitive price or maybe separate the google map connectivity from the rest of the features.

It's electronics are far inferior to that on my Lincoln MKT.  The navigation system suddenly reboots during trips.  The voice activated system apparently only speaks German, as it doesn't understand English.  6/12/17:  Pros:  Car drives great on a long trip, and gets good mileage.  Averaged better than 25 mpg on 780 mile trip from Georgia to Maryland.  Comfort better than average.  Excellent braking system.  Cons:  Repeated navigation system failures where the system suddenly ""reboots"" while driving!  Of course, Audi cannot replicate in the shop!  All data is lost and the trip has to be re-programmed into the system.  Car still leaks going through a car wash.  Audi solution, turn off the A/C when in a car wash!  Key fob suddenly stopped recognizing the car.  Audi reprogrammed.  Said ""it happens sometimes.""  Self-leveling system pump is so loud when it runs it can be heard above the radio, and I am partially deaf!  It sounds like someone is filling a tire with air!  There is no dip stick to check the oil.  You have to turn on the car, and page through the settings to find the ""check oil screen.""  Then it will tell you the oil level, sometimes.  Other times it doesn't seem to work.  The technology on this car is great, when it works.  I have had multiple failures and many more problems then I ever had on my Lincoln MKT.  This is my first and last Audi.12/11/16:  My car was returned from service for this issue after 14 days in the shop.  The mechanic's comments on my receipt follow:   ""Took vehicle thru car wash with A/C on. Found water coming from the bottom of the dash. Removed wiper cowl cover and air intake ducting. No damage to seals or evidence of leaking. Ran vehicle thru car wash again using borascope to watch inside housing intake. Found when foam from car wash hits it is sucked into the vent box. Removed housing from another vehicle and found it did the same thing. Contacted product support. Was advised this condition is ""normal"" and vehicle needs to be in recirculation mode or A/C OFF while going through a car wash!""So according to Audi those of us living in the south should turn off our A/C or put it in recirculation mode to go through a car wash?  This is my 20th new automobile.  I have never had to do any such thing with any other brand.  I'll be trading back to Lincoln next year.  I miss my MKT.This is my first Audi.  I have always purchased Lincolns, but they discontinued the MKT.  I traded my 2011 MKT on a new 2017 Audi Q7 equipped nicely with $66,000 worth of bells and whistles.  I should have kept the MKT!  I first noticed the car leaking when my wife and I drove it through a car wash and water dripped onto her feet.  We returned to the dealer in Jacksonville.  After many hours they reported they could not ""replicate"" the problem.  They said they blew out all the drains, etc. and hopefully our problem was solved.  10 days go by and I visit the car wash again.  Drip, drip, drip into the passenger cabin with about a cup of water during a 2 minute trip through the automated car wash!  I filed a written complaint with the dealer and management.  The service writer called me (not a peep from anyone in management).  He had the car picked up at my home (117 miles from the dealership).  It has been there 7 days now and the last report I received on Thursday (today is Sunday) is that they were going to drive it through a car wash!  No kidding?  It has not rained since I purchased the car.  We are about to take it on a 1500 mile trip to see the grandkids.  I am extremely worried the car will flood if we run into rain!  This is supposed to be a LUXURY automobile!  The electronics are flaky for the radio, and the navigation system is a throw back to the system I had in my Lincoln in 2006!  No touch screen!  A stupid knob to turn to enter data one character at a time!  The MMI system works sometimes, other times it doesn't seem to connect unless I turn off the car, and restart it.  The entertainment system has crashed and rebooted several times without explanation.  As I stated earlier, this is my first Audi.  It will also be my last.

I've only had it since October 9th, but it has a great feeling of quality and solidity. The interior is well made and of high quality components. Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW's comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It's quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn't. Also, because Audi doesn't make enough of the Q7's, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit. (Pretty much plan on no incentives and no discount on price) Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, and would do it again.Starting just over 10,000 Miles, the brakes started making a horrible squeaking and squealing noise coming to a stop and backing up.

I certainly did. I was able to get the vehicle at a small discount which was lucky as some dealers are now asking above sticker or loading on even more packs. The car is a joy to drive and while some have compared the ""Virtual Cockpit"" to a video game, I find it helpful and very effective at communicating information, which is what a dash should do. The placement of controls is excellent, and they are well organized by function. The volume control for all uses (voice, phone, audio) is delightfully located on the console where one's hand naturally falls. The shifter takes a while to get used to, but Audi seems to have anticipated a learning curve. When I first owned it I tried to put it in reverse without stepping on the brake pedal. The dash lit up to inform me I needed to do so. There are a few issues. First, interior storage for the driver is simply unavailable. The console holds virtually nothing and there is not even a sunglass holder. The absences of cubbies is a disappointment, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have had two minor problems. First, one day the alarm system went off every time I tried to lock the vehicle. The dealer (only a mile away, happily) was able to remedy this in less than an hour. Second, the steering wheel is no longer centered after only 2,500 miles. That, too, will be corrected by the dealer. Overall, it's a terrific vehicle as far as I am concerned, despite minor issues.Update, April 2017: Car sat for much of the winter as I had to have emergency back surgery. As soon as I was able, I was driving again, and my very positive impression of the driver's seat was reconfirmed the moment I sat in it again. Very supportive, but not confining. Was able to drive 6 hours (with breaks) and no discomfort. Got stuck in stop-and-go traffic entering Chicago (no surprise) and the Traffic Jam Assist feature, previously untested, worked perfectly. Very impressive. With cruise control set at 73 I got a steady 26+ MPG. Around town am averaging about 22.5. Overall, VERY pleased with vehicle.Update, October 2017: Still very happy with this vehicle. The longer I own it, the more impressed I am with the subtle benefits of Audi's technology. The touch pad works very well, and the audio is amazing. I still remain slightly irritated by the absence of small-item storage for the driver. After 15 months, the build quality is evident. I am delighted overall.Update: April, 2018: Remain very pleased with the vehicle, but as in any long-term relationship some of the bloom does go off the rose. One annoying problem has arisen--noisy brakes when in reverse under most weather condition. Horrendous squeal. Dealer says Audi is ""working on a fix"" but that they were having similar problems with the Q5 (not sure if he meant the new model or the pre-2018). The ""fix"" for the Q5 has not worked well and dealer has no idea when Audi will be able to correct this annoyance. And a few more minor gripes: Why does Audi choose when the headlight washers come on? In previous vehicles, I could do this manually. With Audi, certain parameters must be met before the system operates automatically, or so I am lead to believe. I am not sure they have ever come on. I still wish that Audi had come up with some storage solutions for the driver's cockpit and elsewhere (no storage for the jack??) So, yes, I am increasingly aware that this is an imperfect vehicle in minor ways, but would not hesitate to buy it again. It's still a terrific drive!",5,2017," Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

Cabin is very quiet. First impression is amazing. Nicely designed and finished. As soon as you start driving it you realize run flat tires destroy the comfort you may like from Mercedes. Head up display, as Paul already mentioned, produces ugly glares on a windscreen, right in front of you, distracting and destroying the whole experience of having a head up display technology. The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn't help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector. Driver assistance package seems like an interesting enhancement but the car doesn't fully stop itself as advertised. You better read about all the limitations etc. The last one and a very annoying issue it the air-conditioning. The level of the noise the funs produce on a sunny days is hard to bear.

I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user interface to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang & Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG at average driving speeds of around 75MPH.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range is just as good on the 2017 despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  The keyless entry is still bizarre and its built in ""safety features"" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  The ability to utilize the map on the driver's dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry is still bizarre, the logic behind the ""personal safety feature "" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  I am frequently cussing out some unknown Audi programming or product management team somewhere unknown....  My advice to the Audi programming team is to go try a Lexus keyless entry system, it always works and lets you in the car.  Also, I have given up on the  hands free tailgate opening.  I end up dancing in the parking lot and ultimately just pull out the remote.Seating comfort with the luxury package is excellent and highly configurable.Probably the biggest improvement is in the longevity of the tires and brakes.  I currently have 53,000 miles on the vehicle and I still have 6-7 mm of tread remaining on the original factory Eagle Sport runflats and minimal wear on the original brake pads.  I am very happy with the OEM tires in all weather conditions and they have been great in the Wisconsin weather.So far my only three complaints or observations are:1,) Aforementioned keyless entry and hands free tailgate programming issues. 2.) The tilt steering does not go down close enough to my legs for my own personal taste, seems to stop in too high (straight) of a setting.3.) On an overcast or partially sunny day it seems like the auto fan setting wants to stay in too high of a setting and basically makes you feel cold and also creates more noise than necessary.Overall the vehicle is excellent and I enjoy my daily drive.",5,2017," Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A)"

I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car & Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner's manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn't up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can't even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile.

The 3 Liter engine has plenty of power (333hp), smooth shifts from the 8-spd transmission, and great road grip with little body roll.

Didn't even look because every car I've been in since my '12 Q7 has had them, including every cheap rental. My '14 Audi S7 has them, as did my '14 Silverado. I assumed that there would have been some kind of progression of in the equipment on these cars since 2012. But seemingly, I bought the exact same car again with a slightly different options list. :-)Seems like an easy thing to work around, but they did not even provide a charger socket in the armrest,  just on top of the console, near the shifter. So if you want to charge your phone you can cram it over in the glovebox or have your charger and wiring and phone sitting on top of the console like it was 1996 all over again. It was bad design in 2007 and it's comical in 2015. I'll have to go to a stereo shop to get wiring run into the armrest. Just like it was 1996. :-)Enough whining about that oversight. It's still the capable SUV it was in 2012. Because of the VW TDI scandal, I was unable to purchase the TDI. Which I thought was a phenomenal powertrain. So once I've driven it a while, I will review the new 3.0T more thoroughly.  I was expecting it to be sadly underpowered by comparison, but so far I've been pleased with it. Sadly the back up camera setup has not changed, and compared to my other '14 model cars it seems really tiny and poorly laid out. As I said before, it really seems to be the same car as before but more options have become standard. Or at least more available?  Big ones that I didn't get in my '12 are keyless entry and start, and XM traffic info on the nav display.

The biggest problem is that the controls, for the most part, just make no sense. Let's take safety - all other modern vehicles with front sensors alert you when parking. With this car, you have to enable the feature (or go into reverse first) before the system becomes active. That's not just non-intuitive, but just downright dumb. As for the side assist, make a turn when a car is next to you and nothing will register.  The side assist is only blind spot assist, and there are strict parameters where this function only works.  This is junk - the truth in engineering is that you help the driver and take the risk out of driving by adding modern technology, not that you take technology and make it not work the way it should.  Other controls are not intuitive either - from AC to the pain of having to use the wheel to enter an address for navigation.

Meaning, in manual mode, when you down shift, it won't go into a lower gear unless the RPMs are at a certain level. If the RPMs are too high it won't allow you go to a lower gear. So you don't really have the control that you would have with a true manual transmission. For example, you are going too fast and want to down shift around a curve, it won't let you unless you break and slow down first. That said, the transmission is very smooth if you know what to expect from it. I live in the mountains and the car is heavy, so it is a bit mushy on the curves but handles well. The heaviness is good in the snow and provides for a quiet ride. When the doors shut, you really feel like you are getting your money's worth. Now as far as features, it is fully featured and the details make all the difference. Audi has added nice touches; such as, there are two sun visors on each side and the one visor has the option of swinging to the side while the other blocks sun from the front. Additionally, the visor that swings to the side has a sleek pullout extension that allows for additional sun blockage. Now for the cons: I have only 22k miles and have already replaced all four tires and it’s due for breaks in another 1k miles and the service assistant said that rotors usually need to be replace with each break pad change as well , so maintenance is expensive. Also, I the check oil has come on twice between oil changes even though not due. So I called the dealer and they said I needed to add a can or two to get by until the oil is due for a change and that it is normal for the car to burn oil like that.  I have also had major dashboard warning lights come on twice and had to bring the car in twice, in addition to regular maintenance, for these reasons. The first time I brought it in was for the “Audi Q7 engine emission warning light” and the “Audi Q7 glow plugs pre heating warning light.” They said, the car had been exposed to bad diesel and they ended up having to change the lower fuel pump.  Then after two months I brought it in the second time for the same warning lights. Again, the claim was bad diesel and the fuel filter and all the fuel lines had to be changed. The car is still under warrant, but the thought of have to pay for all this is scary. I’m hoping this has been worked out, but I’m skeptical since I only go to major brand fuel stations.",3,2015," Audi Q7 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A)"

Overall very impressed with the ride and how quite the Q7 is compared to the MB.  The Audi TDI has great performance and rides much-much smooth than the MB GL550 did.   Plenty of room in the Q7 '15 model for us as a family of five.  The technology is great, easy to use and functions as one would think, not a complex interface like MB icommand.  Audi technology features are well done, I have internet enabled in this Q7 and it gets a great signal, we've connect up to 5 devices, the max is 8 devices.  Of Course Bluetooth enabled works well too.   Overall I love how smooth the Q7 is, handles well and while it's a V6 Diesel with 240 HP it has over 400LB of Torque per ft.  The MB GL550 was a bullet at 390HP but rode rough I thought and the technology gap with other car manufactures in the 2012 MB GL series was just not good.    The Audi Q7 gets great milage about 18-19 in the City and over 25-28  m/p/g on the HWY, much higher too is possible, but I have a heavy foot.  One could get in the 30's for HWY milage easy.

Exterior styling is very Euro-slique. LED headlight design is very eye-catching and bright. Crisp ride with almost no vibration or wind noise but a little harsh. I traded out tires for Pirelli scorpions and dropped recommended psi and that has helped. Still rides less cushy than Tahoe or Yukon and especially our Escalade which we traded. The interior is scandanavian like minimalist with easy buttons but lacks a factory DVD player option and any rear factory monitors for entertainment and rear seat climate control that is worth a darn. That's a fail for Volkswagen/audi in my opinion since the Tahoe, Suburban and Escalade have a movie theatre quality rear entertainment system and rear heated and colled seats now. What you get with Audi is impeccable materials. Fit and finish is exceptional. Eveything in cabin is tied down, no rattles like US SUVs. Also, they use REAL leather in seats, not ""pleather"" like US brands. That means the seats actually last and wear over time and dont crack and lose tanning like our Cadillac did. Rear luggage space with 6 people is inadequate. Third row seats only big enough for 7 year old. Cant get two pieces of luggage behind 3rd row seats. Had to buy $800 roof rack. All that said here are the pros...acceleration with turbo diesel is nasty! Once it revs up it just goes like a stabbed rat. 0-60 in close to 5.5! At 75-80 highway it sips fuel. We have seen actual Mpg of 36 and close to 550 miles between fill ups. This engine is superior to any US diesel even in the Fords! I know they may have ""fudged"" on emission reports but I have to say (california tree huggers) worth it!! We have 100k on vehicle now and maintenance has been a problem. It has developed bladder control issues like all my prior Germans and leaks oil all over garage. Dealership said they could replace gasket between engine and trans to fix for a meer $7k. I'll get a drip pan...tnx. It also chews up tires like a 5th grader goes through tennis shoes. The Quattro does not allow a slip like other US AWDs and it takes 2mm of tread off every tight turn. It also consumes brakes like a teenage boy goes through food. Two complete sets of brakes (dealer will not turn rotors?!) in 3 years at $2200 a pop!!! No bueno...volkswagen needs to abandon Bosch and talk to Raybestos or Brembo.  Overall amazing engine and impeccable attention to detail with interior finish, but add 10% to sticker price for post warranty and all maintenance. Its a pricey ride.Update on Q7: the car has now crossed 120k miles. We have had more engine problems and it has been back to dealer twice. We are considering buy-back with VW/Bosch class action for the emissions fraud. We love the gas mileage with the 3.0T diesel and the interior and exterior are holding up very well with little signs of wear. But the vehicle maintenance and reliability is starting to become a problem. Unfortunately, it seems to be following the tradition of my other German autos after 100k where they start to break frequently and the out of warranty repair bills become astronomical. Seeing at least $1100 per visit or more with $120/hour labor charges. We have friends with identical vehicle and they are at the same conclusion. Disappointed with overall experience of ownership with this vehicle, hoped it would hold up better than BMWs. VW needs to work with dealers to drop labor charges and high ownership maintenance costs and build them with more reliable parts.",4,2013," Audi Q7 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A)"

Bought my Q7 TDI after driving/considering the X5D, ML350 Bluetec, Toureg TDI. Only the TDI provided me with the space I needed in cargo area and fairly useable 3rd row, even if only occasionally. I have my own soccer training business and none of the others would fit my gear without much struggle. Close 2nd were the ML, which rode wonderfully, and the X5D which felt very much like a BMW. The Audi is a great combo of all the things I needed. Very powerful, quiet, and tremendous gas mileage! Came from an '07 MDX where I struggled to get 330 miles from full tank, I now get that on a half tank! **Update 7/2016...Still love the Q7! The only thing that I would improve is the WiFi. Hope they have improved it for 2016 because mine is awful. Nine out of ten times I have to take it off WiFi if I'm trying to stream music because it can't do it. Other than that, it's been a great vehicle for us.**Update 1/2017 Cancelled the Audi Connect which provided the WiFi through Sprint. Total waste of money. Hope it's improved.

So my wife and I were looking to swap out our 2012 Lincoln MKX for another luxury vehicle with 3rd row seating to cover the new needs of our expanded family. We had owned the Lincoln for 3 years and aside from repairing a faulty cooling fan, the vehicle performed flawlessly. We drove it on many vacations and loved the ride comfort, features, and style. The only fault at all was the lack of seating which is what led us to search for something new. We thought we had found that in a used red 2008 Audi Q7. We choose this vehicle because we were looking to buy another SUV within the price range that we could sell the used MKX ($15-16k). The Audi won us over with the amount of features, luxury items, sportiness and pedigree being a cousin of Porsche and Volkswagen. The vehicle we purchased had comparable miles as our MKX had (75,000 ish) so we expected a vehicle that would be broken in with a few scratches here and there and maybe some slight wear on the interior. What we received however was something straight out of a comedy. We ordered the vehicle and had it shipped to our house. When the transport arrived the vehicle didn't want to start so they had to boost it to get it off the trailer. While at idle we began to smell gas. Upon inspection we found the fuel tank was pouring gas onto our drive! Went to move the car but it wouldn't start back.We had it towed to the Audi dearlership for repair ($210.00). 3 days later we picked it up after a service recall which repaired the leak free however the leak caused damage to the fuel pump which required replacement ($475.00) and to replace the battery it had to be programmed to the vehicle ($318.00).On the way back home however, the TPMS indicator came on then the ‘Hill Climb Assist Error’ indicator, then the ABS light and then the Brake booster light. Not far after the check engine light came on and the vehicle began to misfire. Additionally, as I was travelling back home the cabin began to get stuffy. I went to turn up the AC and both blowers were not functioning. I opened up the sunroofs and dropped the windows. Turned the stereo on to popping and cracking speakers. Not to be outdone, the charging port that I was using to charge my phone stopped working. As misery sat in on my 65+ mile trek home, it began to rain. I went to roll up the windows and close the sunroofs to find that the rear window wouldn’t go back up and the front sunroof only partially closed and the rear would not shut either. So the final 15 minutes of the drive home was spent getting rained on. After we arrived home my wife helped me force the rear window up and we managed to coax the main moonroof closed however in the process the rear plastic cover of the passenger seat fell off! Additionally, we opened up the rear hatch to gain better access to the rear sunroof but when we went to shut it, the hatch wouldn’t close. It took 10 minutes of coaxing it to finally get it all the way down. The next day we contacted the dealership and told them what had happened. They suggested that it could have been affected by the battery programming (I called BS on this but went along with it) and suggested we bring it back in for a diagnostics test to see. We drove the vehicle back, in the heat, without ac and only able to drive it 55 mph on the highway due to the engine misfire. The dealership to notified us that the AC blower motors were in fact faulty, the speakers were blown and the fiber optics were busted on the stereo (thus disabling the satellite radio and causing a short). The tire pressure monitors were all dead (they run on batteries which expire every 5 years or so and require replacement, even on the spare, to the tune of $275.00 each), the rear window resistor was bad, the sunroofs and hatch control assemblies were faulty , all but one of the charging port connectors were melted at their base and shorted (also something that is prone to failure as we were informed.) The engine misfire was caused by a faulty connection to one of the coils which was easily corrected during the diagnostic test. Overall, however the test alone cost us $330.00. Then the dealership told us the cost for the remaining repairs would total $4,385.00! We ended up getting our $14k back from the purchase and now own a Cadillac Escalade.

Apparently my 20+ year driving experience and owning multiple SUVs/trucks and not having the brakes shot at 15K means nothing. I suggested that the dealer pays for rotors and I pay for pads, so will hear back from Audi in a couple of days. Complaints about the breaks/rotors replacement at early mileage is something that various Audi forums cover well. Thinner break pads (7mm) vs. other luxury SUVs and softer break pad material, all seem to contribute to the issue of premature brake failure. Single use rotors, which are not supposed to be serviced until ~35,000 miles according to Audi Q7 Maintenance Schedule, need to be replaced with every brake job, which can drive the cost up to $2,000 for parts and labor.

This TDI has fantastic fuel economy, gobs of power, handles well for the 5,500# beast it is, looks classy, rides like a dream, and is comfortable enough to drive all day every day without fatigue.   So, what are the cons?  Well, two major things:  1., space use for cargo is horrible; Audi really should have made the car six inches taller.  As it is, cargo room is quite height-limited, and this is something I find quite annoying (quite often).  The fact that it has a third row for seating simply means that there is less cargo space for a useless row that no normal (or even relatively small) human can use with any level of practicality.  2., Too many sensors.  If anyone ever asked the question, ""Is it possible for a car to have too many sensors?""  Audi answered it for us:  Yes, it is!!!!!

My wife fell in love with the drivability, the appointments, and it not having the stigma of elitism (buying a brand badge versus a quality car).  Most of the people we knew at the time had never heard of Audi.  Maybe because we were too poor to even afford one, but we all knew Mercedes and BMW!  My wife didn’t want to drive a badge, she wanted to drive a well-crafted machine that would last a long time.  A few years later, I found a lease return TDI Prestige in Florida that was well priced.  I jumped on it.Why really did we want the Q7 over anything else?  We wanted a 7 passenger vehicle.  There are only four of us in the family, but randomly we will transport friends to and from school and ball games.  So the third row seat didn’t need to cavernous, just legal for short trips.  We wanted a comfortable long distance vehicle.  We regularly travel 2,500 miles across the United States, so we desired something comfortable.  I’m 6’1” and many vehicles don’t fit me.  This fit me like a glove.  In these travels, we travel through all types of weather, including snow.  We also travel back roads a bit also, so we desired a four wheel drive.  We needed something that could tow a 5,000 pound camper.  And we desired 20+ mpg.  This wish list narrowed us down very quickly.  The Q7 was at the top of the list.With nearly 180,000 miles on our Q7, we have done NO major maintenance.  Brakes, oil, tires, battery and other small things like this; but we have done nothing major.  We continue to drive this car as our primary cross-country conveyance.  We have no squeaks, no rattles, no clunks and to broken nobs.  The seats have no tears, rips or bad wearing spots.  This car has really held up to my family.  It has truly held up to the price I paid for it.  Even my fuel mileage increased as I put miles on it.  Currently, we average 25 MPG on the highway, and around 18 in the city.The bad:The OEM brakes.  This is a heavy machine, and the brakes remind you that it is heavy!  Our first brake replacement, we upgraded the rotors and pads and reprogrammed the sensitivity of the brake pedal.  It made an immense difference.Tires.  This is a heavy machine, and it eats tires faster than a minivan.  I finally went to a Conti DWS with a 50,000 warranty.  This way, every time I swap tires at about 40,000 miles, I get $125 discount off the new set.  MMI  The interface with the computer is like jumping from Windows to Apple.

Wife wanted luxury and reliability and I wanted performance and fun.  It wasn't until we looked at the A7 that we found the right combination.  I know you may be thinking ""but you bought the diesel"".  Well test drive the TDI and tell me it doesn't put a grin on you face with all the torque on tap and we just got 39 MPG on a 800 mile trip.  I would classify the car as a GT and in this regard it excels.  It comfortably seats 4 and can still put a smile on your face on a twisty canyon road.  Is it going to hang with a 911......No, but you can't put all your luggage, the dog and 4 people in the 911 either.  The TDI has a slight diesel rumble at idle when cold that is barely noticeable (if you have everything in the car turned off....heater, stereo, etc..) Once in gear and rolling, the car is very quiet and amazingly the TDI has an un-diesel like growl to it when you drop the hammer.  The transmission is super smooth and seems to always be in the right gear for what you want the car to do.  The interior and technology of the car is as cutting edge as your wallet will allow (options) but even the base model is nicely equipped and very functional.  The headlights and interior lighting make nighttime driving less stressful for those that may not see as well at night as they use too.  The A7 has real usable storage space, every person I have shown the lift back to has been amazed at how much storage there is (notice I didn't use the word trunk space as no trunk can compare, it closer to an SUV than a car).

I also had the windows tinted, which in Florida is a big help.  The car looks fantastic without being overly showy - I wanted something that didn't advertise it's price too loudly.  The car is very fast but in a very subtle way... I find myself doing 100 feeling like I would doing 60 in a lesser car.  Exceptionally quiet and smooth riding.  A far as comfort, the heated/cooled seats work very quickly and the massage function on the Comfort Seating Package is ridiculously great.  I find myself using it almost 100% of the time. The seats themselves offer as many adjustments as I could imagine and are very comfortable and supportive when cornering quickly.   The B&O stereo is outstanding, although I miss a graphic equalizer.  The AC is somehow 10x better than my last BMW, both faster and stronger.  Where I was running the old AC at 63-65 degrees, I'm at 69-72 with this car.  The 4G hotspot works well and saves my cell phone's data plan.  The only negatives I can think of are that Apple CarPlay still doesn't support  apps I consider necessary like Waze and the SiriusXM app.  Also driving with all the tech options activated it can be a bit overwhelming (hence my wife's nickname).  If you want to just drive the car I suggest the following: Put down the LCD screen using the button on the dash, it will pop up only when needed (this also looks cool).

Crush the pedal and it pins you back in the seat, the engine giving a subtle growl that quickly becomes a roar. 70mph comes fast, as the steering, handling, and balance tighten. It is the best performing sedan I've ever driven. Hit the gas out of the apex and it hunkers down and rockets out of the turn. The curve speed sign says 40mph? Try 70 and you will be fine. The interior is sumptuous, ergonomic, and classy without being fussy. The electronic systems are user-friendly but have layers and layers of functionality once you start exploring. In the snow, this car outperforms the most eager SUV. Speaking of SUVs, when you open the lift gate you have a storage cave that serves almost any cargo need. Every possible situation was contemplated with this car. This A7 feels like an extension of me--more so the longer I own it.

The navigation system is excellent and it also provides you with traffic conditions and problems ahead.

The seat massagers are a great feature for the driver and passengers and the climate control is excellent for front and back seats.  It has the smoothest ride of any car that I have ever been in.  There are roads that I regularly drive on that you have to take slow in my wife's Toyota Sienna of you'll get bumped around that I can drive over at normal speed and not even feel.  The camera that gives you a 360 degree view when you are parking or pulling out of a spot is a phenomenal feature.   It's tough to live without when you're driving a ""normal car'. I get 30 MPG on the highway, which is completely unexpected for this land yacht.  This is car is so luxurious that my wife tells me my expectations are too high when we look at other cars.  Once you drive this car, you're going to have a tough time downgrading to another vehicle.  About the only complaint that i can come up with is the in-car wifi, which only has 3G capability and the navi system which is based on google maps which you have to have the 3G service for which is unfortunate, but I mostly use Waze for navigation anyway.

But Audi is not telling its customers something very important.  If this car is in a wreck, it can take up to 3 months to repair.    I was in a rear end collision over 6 weeks ago.  The repair work has not even started.  The reason is that Audi limits collision repairs to one shop in any particular city.  I live in a city with 5 million people.  There is only one shop that can repair the vehicle and the shop has only one technician who is authorized to do the work.  As there are five other cars waiting to be repaired ahead of me, it will be at least another month before I may see the car back.  I filed a complaint with Audi, and they told me the reason for this insane policy is that the vehicle is aluminium and requires special training to repair.  With all due respect to Audi, there are many other cars made of aluminium and many other repair shops that can perform the repair.  So to make sure that these shops cannot do the repair, Audi will not sell them the parts. Audi refused to provide me with an alternative equivalent vehicle and refused to buy the car back.  It is insane to purchase a car which costs between $90 and $100k and for Audi to create a situation where it is impossible get it repaired in a reasonable period of time.

I can't help but to compare the drive, handling and ride quality of the A8L to a Lexus LS460L I traded for my A6 earlier this year. The Audi beats the Lexus hands down. This A8 L handles so securely for such a large car. The V6 is strong, and provides plenty of power. The car is hushed, substantial, has a huge back seat, yet handles like a smaller sedan. Technology is top notch, with the exception of no USB ports? What was Audi thinking? Otherwise, the navigation is quite good. Interior fit and finish is superb, with great feel at every touch. The massaging and ventilated seats are a nice touch as well. Fuel economy with the V6 is excellent, at 34 mpg in a 1000 mile trip at highway speeds in excess of 75 mph.

Such a shame that VW/Audi felt they had to cheat on the emissions tests, because the repairs done to meet spec had virtually no impact on the car's operation.  About all they did was set the shift points at a higher RPM.  But because of the cheating, diesel cars are probably dead in the US market.  One can make a good case that the emission standards are ridiculously high, but that's not the point.  The problem is that VW/Audi cheated to get around them...and they wouldn't have had to.  Because of all this, the value of these cars has fallen through the floor.  But if you can get one for a song, you won't be disappointed.  The car has plenty of power, handles beautifully, rides very comfortably, and gets amazing fuel economy for its size.  I have easily hit mid-40 mpg on freeway trips (at least according to the computer).  The only thing that falls down is the navigation system.  The voice activation is poor.  It often can't find a specific address.  It is slow.  Audi connect, which overlays Google Earth on the map, is a neat toy, but it is too expensive for what it is.  My other gripe is repair costs.  Once the warranty expires, this baby is going to be expensive.  It uses odd size tires...and goes through them quickly.  I think I paid about $1600 for a set of four new Michelins.  At least they are good tires.  The Pirellis that were original were horrible.  Very noisy.  And the brakes don't last very long either.  New front pads and rotors at around 30K...one independent shop quoted $1200...got them done at another for around $800.  Can't imagine what the dealer would get.  Dealer gets $100 for a set of wiper blades, for Pete's sake.  Once the Audi Care expires, routine maintenance goes to an independent.  Dealer prices are beyond belief.

The next item was to relocated the relay to another spot in the car so I would not hear the relay. Both of this approaches did not address the core issue of the problem why is the relay started working that way. Instead it appears that Audi was trying to mask the issue hope the owner would go away.

It has been trouble free for the past 1.5 years and I have added 10k miles to the odometer.  I got a stage 1 tune which is a mild upgrade in power and makes the car go fast.I spotted this car online and drove almost 3 hours in heavy traffic to finally locate this car.  I was not in a good mood by the time I got to the dealership.  When they told me the car was on their auxiliary lot one mile away I almost got back in my car to leave.  The dealer grabbed a car and talked me into riding with him over to this other lot.  The moment I sat in this Audi TT and started the engine I was grinning ear to ear.  This 2012 Audi TT is new to me for one month now.  I love driving it.  My wife loves driving it and riding in it.  That is a first and quite remarkable since I have previously owned two other roadsters which she did not care to ride in or even drive.  I have had a Miata and Z4.  Both are great for driving in the mountains.  I liked the Miata for its quick nimble handling (after some suspension mods and addition of a roll bar) but it was a bit cramped and underpowered for my tastes.  The Z4 didn't lack power and had good interior room but lacked that nimble feel.  Trammeling was a bit annoying as well.  This TT is the best of both and then some.  It has the nimble handling and feel way beyond the Miata and is even a bit faster than the Z4.  It also has the interior room I want.  The sound of the engine and the fast, crisp shifts of this transmission are the best ever to me.  The Audi interior is pleasing to the eye and probably the nicest interior of any car in this class.  My only gripe so far is the Navigation/Entertainment system.  Entering an address or phone number into this radio has gotta be the most painful and cumbersome system I have ever encountered.  It works fine but plan some prep time before a trip to set up a route.  One good feature about this radio however is the screen.  It is bright and clear even in direct sunlight with the top down.

I've owned or leased 2 first generation, 3 second generation and now my third generation TT.  This is the best yet in all respects:  design, performance, miles-per-gallon, technology and fun.  Even one of my relatives who is not a car person marveled at the car and was especially impressed with the safety features, including the blind spot warning feature.  It's beautiful on the outside with just enough edge to keep it fresh but still maintains the overall sophistication and timeless design of the original.  It hugs the road like no other, and I find myself accelerating into curves.  The seats are exceptionally comfortable and adjustable.  I'm not a race care driver, but I've certainly had no trouble getting this car up to 70-80 MPH in no time at all.  I still love the automatic spoiler.  But it's the technology that's the true star.  The virtual cockpit is amazing.  While it took my maybe half a day to get used to it (definitely worth reading the owner's manual), once I did, it became intuitive.  You barely have to take your eyes off the road (just a simple glance down) and never have to take your hands off the wheel to manage any and all functions.  While not necessary, I have opted for Audi Connect and find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I especially like that I can have the system read my texts and emails to me out loud.  I feel obligated to find something to criticize; the only thing I would request is to be able to adjust the lumbar support up and down more -- a wider range of vertical motion.

I've owned it for multiple years now and every time I think I want to look at other cars for a possible trade, I get in and drive and realize it still holds my heart.  This is a nice little sports car that gives great handling, great acceleration and puts a smile on the face of the driver.  Every time.  I did extensive searching when I made the change from my previous car ('99 Sebring convertible) and was determined to have another convertible.  I looked at just about every convertible in the market at that time and no other had the combination of perks and handling for which I searched.  Once that decision was made, finding this car took another six months--there just weren't that many with the 3.2L engine out there that were for sale!  I ended up having it shipped from Chicago down to the Dallas area.  Since then it has been my daily driver and I have learned all its quirks and joys.  Its acceleration is beyond fun and when I put it into launch mode, it borders on scary.  I know many complain that an automatic transmission is just boring, but for my needs I find it to be just right.  And when I want to get aggressive with my driving, going into Sport mode and using those flappy paddles is just great.            CONS:  One thing I have noted as a minus is the ease of tires braking loose during heavy braking.  It took me a while to get used to how the brakes work on this car, but once that was done, it's been resolved.  My only real complaint I would lodge against the car is the navigation system, but I have the same gripe on every other car I've driven that includes it (Audi A8L, Chevrolet Impala and Malibu).  The nav systems are ALL slow to respond, much less helpful than a Garmin or other dedicated GPS.  For that reason, I've always maintained a Garmin, especially for trips.         MAINTENANCE has not been too much of a problem with this car, but I would note I have had issues with the convertible action.  While still under warranty I had the motors for that replaced.  There also seems to be a real issue with keeping the top down sensor adjusted correctly and has had to be serviced on multiple occasions.  Their statement that you can be driving up to 18 mph and open/close the top is a LIE, so much so that their technicians state I should only actuate the roof when parked on a level surface with the brake held in place.  Perhaps in the past decade they have repaired that function, but I would suspect not.  I will be needing to take it in to get this irritation looked at AGAIN.  As it stands presently, I frequently have to spend a couple of minutes lowering/raising/lowering the top until the status light goes out.  If I don't it beeps out a warning that the top is not completely opened every couple of minutes--very irritating.  IN CONCLUSION, I would say this is a great little car to drive and I would recommend you try one out before just putting thoughts of a TT out of your mind since it's not a BMW or Benz or whatever else you might be considering.

The ""car"" before the Audi was a Rav4 SUV.  (Also a couple of station wagons along the way between convertibles.)  Stepping up in size is not a problem, stepping down is taking some getting use to.  With less than one month ownership I have taken a trip from Chicago area around Lake Michigan and a second trip to Door County in WI.  I am learning that a 77 year old body is not as flexible as a 35 year old one.  Getting in, sitting and driving is not the problem.  It is getting out after a few hours of driving.  One problem is blocking the sun with the top up or down.  The driver sun screen is very small.  The Rav4 had a sun screen that when on the side window could be slide back to do a good job of blocking the sun from the side.  The Audi does not.  Most of the other ""issues"" with the car are due to lack of knowledge and education.  Hopefully these will decrease with time.  Biggest problem is finding cheap high octane gasoline for the car.

I traded out of my low mileage 2014 model entirely based on the migration of virtually all of the latest technology & safety features from the higher end Audi models to the current A4 & A5 platforms.  Especially important to me was inclusion of Audi's version of cross traffic (rear) monitoring; although my 2014 had ""Blind Spot Monitoring"", this back-up feature was not previously available in the A5.  IMO, this is an almost essential safety feature where I live because of the number of large cars & pick-up trucks which make backing out of parking spaces a nightmare.  I also enjoy the convenience of the Heads Up Display and the Virtual Cockpit rendering of the main display.  The optional adaptive cruise control provides semi-autonomous driving and has been of great assistance while driving in the stop and go traffic conditions which I encounter on a daily basis. The 2018 model has a more powerful engine and there has been further improvement of the suspension system.  My Prestige trim level's insulated cloth top now provides better sound insulation than in the 2014 model and there has been an improvement in the way in which the top stores in the trunk (relative to storage capacity).  I preferred the more classic body style of the 2014 A5, as the newly sharpened/enhanced sheet metal lines seem only to have been changed to compete with BMW & M-B.  I truly dislike what has been done to the interior of the car.  Compared to the ""quiet"" and integrated European appearance of the 2014 A5.  To me, the straight across dashboard of the 2018 looks like a mid-80s GM product.  Optional wood veneers shriek ""plastic"" and the standard shiny metal trim doesn't match the other metallic components in the cockpit.  I'm not a fan of the new non-retractable separate (top center dash mounted) display screen which has become favored by European makers; note that this display is NOT a touch screen, but is controlled by a large (""MMI"") knob in the center console.  It is convenient, however, to be able to show different displays on this screen and the virtual cockpit, giving the driver exceptional control of information.  The 2018 A5 accepts Android Auto and Apple Car Play and there is seamless integration of these programs with regards to navigation and media; unfortunately, Audi does not currently permit ""Waze"" or other non-media applications in Android Auto (compared with other manufacturers).   My biggest disappointment is with the lack of interior space in the cabin.  The glove box is now essentially useless, as Audi has moved the bulky CD & SD card player to that location from the center stack; there isn't even enough room to put the owner's manual case there (I've NEVER owned a car with that limitation).   The center console storage space is VERY shallow and not completely covered by the adjustable center arm rest; a small covered cubbyhole is provided in the lower dash to the left of the driver in a location which is not easy to safely access while driving.  Please note that Audi does not provide ANY ability to equip the A5 with an ash tray & lighter/receptacle, not even as a build option when ordering the car to specifications from Germany (this option is available in Europe).  It seems that there was little (if any) input from actual drivers regarding these convenience features.  Setting aside my complaints about the shortcomings of the interior space, I absolutely LOVE the 2018 A5.  Its combination of all precise wheel drive handling in any weather/road condition, more powerful engine and outstanding/state-of-the-art technology made it a no-brainer for me to upgrade from an already superb 2014 A5 Cabriolet.",5,2018," Audi A5 Convertible Prestige quattro 2dr Convertible AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)"

Very inflexible dealer.  I traded for the new and much larger Volvo S90 and love it.  For the same cost, it has Auto pilot and a huge touch screen similar to the Tesla.  It also has a huge back seat and drives like the Audi and with same gas mileage.  I’m much happier with my Volvo and use the auto pilot all the time.  I no longer mess with the Audi mouse and click on my touch screen directly.  Also, the screen is vertical so I can see more of what’s ahead of me and not wasted space like in the Audi screen.  Lastly, the Volvo has amazing headlights that turn with auto bright at night that makes night look like day.",3,2018," Audi A5 Coupe Premium Plus quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)"

And when my 2000 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8 T finally died 17 years after I bought it brand new, I figured it was time for an upgrade.   I skipped VW and went straight to the Audi dealership. The S8 was lovely, but a bit out of my price range. The A3, with that high roof, looked too much like my old Jetta.  It would make a nice Pope-mobile. And then there sat the A5. The four door is nice but I wasn't going to be hauling my family around in this car. We have a Yukon XL for that. This one is just to move my butt up and down the George Washington Parkway, alone, in comfort--it had to be a Coupe.   If you compare the coupe to the sportback, well there is no contest. I guess if you have  three kids, you may be compelled to buy the sportback, which gives you an extra seat in the middle. I have more than three kids, so I might as well have been buying a Ducati. I was a little apprehensive about the 2.0T, which powers quite a few smaller VWs in lesser forms, but this car flies: 0-60 in 5 sec.  Good enough for me, who has no plans to take it to the drag strip.  It's a great car.",5,2018," Audi A5 Coupe Prestige quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)"

My last one was a 2010, and I loved the car - but it had gotten long in the tooth. The 2018 prestige coupe seems much better mechanically than the 2010, and both the engine and transmission are incredible. In addition, the car seems much quicker than the statistics Audi publishes, particularly in the sport mode. The steering is also very good for electric steering, and isn't too light and doesn't entirely lack road feel as many do. The electronics are also superb. In addition, the cabin materials are exceptional, and the fit and finish seems as perfect as a car can be. On the less than great side, the flat dash with the MMI screen stuck to it is sort of generic looking, and I don't think it is anywhere near as nicely designed as in the previous model. The appearance of the interior is nice, but that's about all it is. Also, the redesigned body appearance is, in my view, just okay. I used to like just looking at my dark metallic blue 2010 A5, and I thought it was truly beautiful; the 2018 model's appearance is less than awe inspiring, and lacks the uniqueness and character of the model it replaced. That's true of the interior design as well. Both are sort of bland, and there's nothing about them that stands out from the crowd.

The car is very, very quiet on decent roads, and the interior is immaculate.  It's not something you'll use to haul more than 2 people around for more than a few miles at a time, and I knew this going in.  The storage room is exceptional for this size of car.  Quattro system really makes you feel confident on the road.  I absolutely love the look of this car both inside and out.  The base safety systems that come with this car are very nice to have.  Frustrations are few but I'll note them now.  First, I wish they'd have made the gas tank a few gallons bigger, as I feel like range is too short if you're driving in the city.  I am replacing a 2009 Acura TSX which had about a 16 gal tank, so it's a bit annoying.  Second, Apple Carplay is really convenient and one reason I bought the car.  However, it's glitchy.  I don't know if it's Carplay in general, or as it relates to Audi, but they have programming problems that need fixes.  It glitches out after Audi Presense is engaged, requiring you to unplug and replug your phone in to get it to work.  Even with a brand new Apple cord, it fails to connect at times.  I've had problems with it freezing, or crashing my phone while in the middle of navigation.  I don't know if this is primarily an apple problem or an audi problem, but it can be maddening at times.  I have an Iphone 6+, so it is a relatively 'older' phone, maybe that's some of it.  Also, I was using 3rd party app Pandora, it could be from that.  Last complaint is that basic front of cockpit storage is pretty inadequate.  No sunglass storage, very little center console storage (probably for the better so I don't stash useless things).  If I can get the Carplay glitches worked out I would say I'm completely happy with the car.

Sure, the car is stylish on the outside and the performance is quite good, but Audi didn't live to the expectations with the interior and controls design. I bought the A5 Premium Plus with the Technology Package.Here is the good:- Stylish exterior- Great engine performance- Good MPG performance as related to the HP of the engine- High quality interior materials- Premium sound is amazingHere is the bad:- The controls are quite confusing. It is difficult to navigate the overall controls and features. Any system that forces you to look down to find a specific button is plain dangerous. All controls for the Multimedia system are on the center console between the driver and passenger.- Voice recognition is poor, even after going through the 5-minute voice training program.- Integration with Bluetooth devices is poor. I had to constantly turn off and turn on the Bluetooth on my iPhone for the car to pick it up. It does not happen on my wife's Honda Odyssey.- Maps on the navigation system are quite old; streets that are over 3-years old do not show up on the map.- There is only one usable cup-holder on the front. For some strange reason, Audi decided to include a cup holder in which only a baby bottle would fit.- No touch-screen functionality. Everything is controlled through a joystick in the center console, forcing you to look down whenever you want to adjust anything on the car.- If you use Spotify, Pandora, or any other music service through Bluetooth, the system does not allow you to skip tracks with the steering-wheel-mounted controls. You have to use the center console.- The steering-wheel controls are track-wheels instead of levers and buttons. They are very sensitive to the touch and you have to be careful not to roll the wheel more than one notch.- No USB ports. Only SD card slot (who uses a SD Card slot for music anyways?)I got rid of my Audi A5 just after 9 months. It was just to uncomfortable and awkward to control.

The car is incredibly functional with all wheel drive, comfortable interior, great looks and good fuel economy.  The convertible works effortlessly, and it is incredibly quiet with the top up, as well as warm during the winter.  The attention to detail is exceptional with high quality materials and options that will impress most drivers.  The car is very competent on the road at high speeds, but does equally well as a relaxed touring car at slower speeds with the top down.  I never thought I would ever enjoy owning a car like this, especially driving it year-round!  I picked mine up used with very low miles, and for the price it was just too good to pass up.  It still has the balance of the factory warranty, and the dealer has been great so far.A few highlights: The Bang and Olufsen stereo will not disappoint, even with the top down.  The MMI Nav system has an incredible amount of features, but it does take time to master, so keep your owner's manual close.  The heated seats coupled with the neck warmers and wind deflector will keep you cozy with the top down even on very cold days.  The Quattro system is incredibly competent on slippery roads.  This is just such a complete package in a convertible that's designed to be used as a daily driver.Audi's quality seems to have increased significantly in recent years, so hopefully the car will stand the test of time.  So far I have had great luck with the dealer for servicing.  Seems as though Audi is trying very hard to compete successfully against the other luxury brands.Update on 7/19/16:  Been putting a lot of miles on the A5, and now at 21,000.  It continues to be a great car to own.  I did need to replace the tires though because of an alignment issue which caused the Pirellis to make a lot of noise.  Other than that, it has been pretty much a trouble free ride with up to 30 mpg on the highway.  It's an easy car to live with on a daily basis.Update on 1/20/17:  Miles are now at 27,000 and the Audi continues to be trouble free.  I put a set of Michelin Alpin Sports on for winter, and the car is wonderfully competent on slippery roads.  A small disappointment is the sound quality of SiriusXM, especially when compared to HD FM stations and CDs.  SiriusXM does not allow the sounds system to show off all it can truly do.  Other than that, I do enjoy owning this vehicle a lot.  I can't wait until it's warm enough again to put the top down!Update on 1/23/18:  Miles are now at 42,000.  The last year has been relatively trouble-free with the A5.  The only issue was a bad fuel injector that was replaced under warranty.  Other than that, the car continues to be a delight to own and drive.  The mileage continues to be very good, it's always enjoyable to drive, and it goes like a tank in the winter.

It did have an oil burning issue that is common to certain years of a4/a5/q5 with the 2.0t engine.  This was fixed under warranty without issue and the car hasn't burnt a drop of oil since.  Only other unscheduled maintenance in 4 years was a pcv valve that recently went bad and started making a screeching noise ($350 iirc).  Overall at 73k miles now it has been very reliable, maybe moreso than expected, given my previous experience with owning vw/Audi, knock on wood.  The car is on its 3rd set of tires, and I have not replaced brake pads and rotors yet in the 4 years and 50k miles I have owned it. City driving will give 21-22 mpg, with 30+ on the freeway (I've gotten over 500 miles on a tank before).  The car is not fast but it is quick enough, and handles well.  The build quality is great, especially interior materials, with no significant rattles on what is almost a 6 year old car.  Rear seat space is good for a two door - I am 6'2 and have ridden back there comfortably on reasonably short trips.  Trunk is large for a coupe.  If I could change anything, it would be to have the sunroof open and not just tilt.  Bluetooth audio would also be nice, not just phone compatibility. I am still a huge fan of the a5's styling and think it will look classic for years to come.  I plan to keep it for at least a few more years.

Recently, the programmable radio buttons and MMI began to malfunction.  I brought it in for service expecting a repair under warranty and was told that the problem was “likely” due to liquids spilling onto the buttons, not covered by the warranty.  I would tend to agree with this diagnosis BECAUSE the radio buttons are positioned directly next to the cup holders.  It is almost impossible to avoid spilling liquid into the buttons because of this design.  Even the motion of the car with a cup of liquid in the holder could easily cause liquid to spill into the radio buttons.  Nevertheless, this is clearly a design flaw with the center console.  I have been a computer engineer since 1983 therefore my ability to recognize a user interface design issue is my business.  But it doesn’t take an engineer to recognize the poor design of the center console.  I contacted Audi customer support AudiCustomerExperienceCenter@audi.com and after waiting almost two months, the customer service rep never bothered to provide a final response.  Instead, I had to escalate, searching the internet for another way to contact Audi, who agreed to cover only the parts ($600) but not the labor costs ($300).  I did not accept this offer because the design of the center console is the cause of this issue because it’s inevitable that liquid will spill into the radio buttons given that they are positioned right next to the cup holder.  So there you have it.  Audi has decided to lose a customer for $300 over what in my opinion and experience is a design flaw.  This is my second A4.

Yes, the exterior may be a bit conservative compared to the others in the segment - but it's classy without being gaudy. The interior is a technical marvel. The Virtual Cockpit has to be seen to be believed, none of the competitors can match Audi's current tech and Google Earth maps. Apple Car Play works seamlessly and the MMI system is fairly intuitive. With the exception of the Acura, the rival cars get pricey when you add the tech and safety features already in the Premium Plus version of the Audi A4. The ride and handling is very good, granted the BMW still shines in this area - but their tech is somewhat dated. In addition, the A4 cabin is very quiet and inviting. The 19 speaker Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system is remarkable, it sounds like your virtually in a live concert. The Acura A-Spec is the probably the best value proposition and has more horses but lacks the refinement of the Audi and Acura's duel screen infotainment system seems dated even though refreshed in 2017.

It’s like coming home when I get into it. All the controls are in the right place. It’s still zippy fast and the gas mileage compared to my previous Acura MDX has been a godsend.

Completely unacceptable in my opinion.   We had a Mercedes C300, traded it for the Audi A4.  We will go back to Mercedes with the next purchase.

I traded in a 2013 BMW 320i with Stage 1 Dinan 6 speed manual (comparable to stock 328 i) for 2017 Audi A4 Premium Quattro. When I did the test drive, I drove the one with sport package and Premium Plus trim. I chose this car over Lexus IS 350/IS200t/IS300 , Jaguar XE, BMW 328i and BMW 340i(yeah!) first time around. the key reason was the responsiveness of 7 speed Dual Clutch transmission(coming from manual). Although other brands have numbers behind them, the transmission-engine combination can challenge the higher engine trim Jaguars and BMWs and it is way more refined. The Quattro system is obvious while cornering or taking turns with confidence, especially when it is wet. Dallas toll roads can be very prone to hydroplaning and boy, does it rain hard here.   First time around.. to save costs, I went with the Premium.  The car drove well(super quick with launch control and sport mode, paddles), but I was not happy with the speakers and sound system, although I am far from being an audiophile and I was not a fan of the base system and I was not a fan of the Ibis white exterior without the S-Line trim. So decided to bite the bullet and trade it in with 6200 miles and 6 months of ownership for 2017 A4 with Premium Plus/-Quattro with Sport Package. Although sport suspension and seats don't seem to make a difference on paper, they make a big difference in the way this car handles. I don't have the adaptive damper package which is available in Prestige trim, but this suspension is how this car should be in the first place. It is way more planted without being jarring and a ride quality/comfort above anything else in its genre. But coming from BMW, this is more close to the handling I am used to. I am a happy camper now. I love the Android Auto/Apple CarPlay with the Bang and Olufsen 3D sound. I personally stayed away from Tech Package(although cool and envy inducing and great conversation piece) since in my opinion, it is a little too risky to have in a first year German vehicle...So bottom line is for those normal people(not the trackers and oversteer/opposite lock enthusiats) migrating from BMW and convinced about 2017 A4(which should  not be difficult  ), I would highly recommend checking the Sport Package and Quattro. For someone with slightly elevated sense of sportiness in a car, it is a perfect fit for me.

The tech is top of the class but if you enjoy driving this is not the car for you. Too often on long trips and such will behave like a fwd vehicle, the steering sucks even with the sport package (no way to fix that dead on center Audi feel- it's not old Lincoln bad by any means but not in league with Mercedes' , BMW's, Cadillac's, etc...) , the suspension is not close to what the three series has (I even opted for the adaptive one) - this has been the most disappointing car for me that I have ever purchased -mainly because I want to love it as it is the only one that checked all the boxes on what I wanted (tech features , bang and olufsen sound system, top safety pick, great real world fuel economy, love the looks, etc) Driving around town it can be a lot of fun but if you aren't constantly pushing the car then it loses any illusion of a sporting nature and becomes a very bland drive. If they could get it to have the road manners it does when pushed all the time then it would be an awesome vehicle , just disappointing otherwise.- Update- I got rid of the vehicle and got an Alfa Romeo Giulia and have not looked back; the interior is not finished as nicely as the A4 and the rear seat legroom is not quite as big but drive one and you’ll understand. Hopefully Audi can learn from corporate cousin Porsche how to make a vehicle that actually feels nice to drive- they have some of the best styling in the industry and fit and finish is great as well.",2,2017," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)"

The car feels nimble and smooth weaving in and out of traffic.  My previous car was a 6 cylinder Infiniti g35 this car feels faster and more agile and does 10mpg better fuel efficiency.  I did one long trip out the car on comfort ride and did 33mpg averaging around 75 mph.   One thing I think could be better is the engine auto off...

I owned the current generation Passat, but traded it in a few years ago for a 328i. I loved the beemer and always missed the Passat for its all around good road manners and build quality. Needless to say the Audi is a finer automobile than the Passat with similarities. This is our 3rd Audi in 10 years. They are underrated. This is as good as it gets for a mid sized sedan. And it's design, inside and out is classic and practical, and will look good on the road for years. The new generation should have had a little more standout change. You will be very pleased with your gas mileage. Once you buy a German made vehicle you will find it difficult to settle for anything else.....in my opinion. And my updated review: 6 months later. I grew very bored of this Audi, because, well, it's boring. It is actually little better, if at all,than the Passat. Coming up my driveway into the garage is where the turbo lag problem really "" shines"". The front wheel drive in combination with the light front end and too powerful engine is downright dangerous if you are trying to pass someone. Many times, I nearly lost control of the car. It is time for Audi to add more value to this car. It is just too bare bones for 40k. You don't see many on the road in the luxury drenched area I reside....that's telling.

It was really a fun car, with enough power and great dynamics. Since I was getting older, and my wife needed an automatic and was sitting in traffic a lot, we decided to get an automatic with more linear power(read I6/V6). Shopped around for Lexus IS350 and BMW 340i. 340i was good, but moving from manual to automatic, I didn't find the transmission react fast enough for my tastes. IS350 with its 8-speed transmission was also not as responsive. So I started looking for vehicles with dual-clutch given faster shift times and better response. Audi A4 is one of the few cars in the market with 7 speed DCT in the price range and new 2.0T motor is torque rich and in fact I found the vehicle better than sportier S3. Also even the base trim(Premium) has the Android Auto/Apple Play combo negating the need for nav package(mine has Convenience package, which is a must-have). And Quattro with rear-bias is another feature worth paying for. All in all, I got almost 5K off sticker on a brand-new vehicle which is a way better deal than BMW 328i(RWD),  Lexus IS300(AWD) and Acura TLX-V6 SH-AWD which are way out of Audi's league in terms of responsiveness and ride quality. Handling is little better in BMW, but everything else is dated. Previous Audis never impressed me, but this vehicle is quite a revelation and definitely worth considering if you are in market for entry level sporty-luxury sedans.

I love this car. First time I've had an Audi I'm coming out of a 2014 BMW 428i coupe. This car is light years ahead of the BMW in terms of technology. The car my dealer had on the lot had the full tech and driver assistance packages. I wasn't planning to get all of these features but I got a great price on the car and I do love the features. The heads-up display is awesome. I love the highly customizable LED interior lighting too. The virtual cockpit along with large center screen are so amazingly clear and easy to use. I love how well thought out the graphics are. The fit and finish inside is very good everything from the paint finish to the seams inside and out. No rattles or anything. The front seats (which my car has the warm weather package and in Florida that's a must) are very comfortable. Love the design, headlights, tail lights, grille, wheels on my Prestige with gray/silver 2 tone. This car looks so sharp, literally. If I had to give anything that could use improvement, and this is really hard, I'd say: the bang and olufsen stereo doesn't sound as good as my Harman Kardon system in my BMW.

Right now, I think it offers the best mix of tech, performance and luxury in the class, at least until the next 3-series or whatever leapfrogs it. Pros: - The tech goodies are really impressive. Virtual Cockpit is fantastic and having the nav right in front of you in a huge display is actually very useful. It's easy to learn the basic functions of the infotainment system, but it is worth the time to dig deeper and really understand all the different ways you can customize the experience. It makes the car a lot more enjoyable. Even with all the tech, the usability is much better than Mercedes and Lexus. Honestly, you really need to get the technology package to get the best out of this car. - Beyond the gadgets, this is a very good driver's car. Acceleration and braking are very strong, especially with quattro. The ride is firm but controlled. The steering is lighter than I would prefer though. - The interior is not as rich as the C-Class and the GLC, but the materials are high quality, visibility is excellent and the look is very clean and modern. I am 6'2"" with really broad shoulders and size 14 feet, and I have enough head and legroom in the front. I did not fit well at all in the C300, IS and Jaguar XE. The 3 series also has a pretty roomy cabin.- It doesn't use run-flats and has an actual spare tire. I never cared until my wife and I both had flats last year. I had a spare tire. She didn't. I was able to get moving again. She had to get towed. Enough said. Cons: - Setting up the AudiConnect trial was a pain that required multiple phone calls and websites. I was told there were issues with both the new A4 and Q7. I work in tech, so I was able to muddle through this and get everything set up, but Audi really needs to improve the process. - Exterior styling is handsome, but too much like the last generation A4 and the current A3. It's really difficult to tell them apart at first glance. It would have been nice if the new A4 was a little more distinctive- Interior storage could be better. I love the adjustable center armrest, which seems to be a VW/Audi signature, but it doesn't fully cover the compartment, so you can't store anything showy in there.

Obviously, BMW car dealers only had cars with most of the high end stuff and even that we were able to find the right car, the price tag was high since wanted to stick to the 240 Hp of the 328 vs the 180hp of the 320.My wife owns an Audi Q5 and we happened to be in the dealer for a service and started to look around the brand new Audi A4 and learned about the upgrades on the design and technology and fell in love with the new car.This model comes with a 252hp engine, 0-60 in 5.8 sec and driving modes that made me forgot my intentions to buy another BMW.Some of the Pros that I see vs BMW:1. Tires (of course)2. Value. you get a 328 kind of performance with a 320 price tag3. Car play. Love the integration with your smart phone4. Space.5. The premium model it was perfectly packed to my needs, only thing I didn't need but is included is the rear view camera and got a credit for its cost!6. More comfortable than the BMW. Although sporty, it rides extremely well!The only minor thing that I have notice is that there is a little bit of reaction time when you press the accelerator, but once is going is pretty amazing.3 years ago I test drove an A4 before getting my 328 and there were not even close, and while purist may say that BMW performance is better I will say that you get 95% of the BMW with 85% of the cost which to me is a pretty good value for your money",5,2017," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)"

Audi was smart enough to keep somewhat of the same exterior design. They were smart enough to add technology to the interior cabinet in place of big outside body changes.   With that said, the inside cabinet has totally changed - for the BETTER. There is more room and comfort, better placement of hand controls, a well-placed cup holder, and three very smart user display areas across the center console, driver dashboard, and windshield .  Compared to the previous model, it is a comfortable rocketship with added safely technology and conveniences surrounding the entire cabinet, including the heated back seats.  The only big drawback is the Apple CarPlay needs to be connected via a cable and not via wireless bluetooth. Yes, we are Apple iPhone users.  Another concern is BMW, Mercedes, and other car manufacturers moving away from Apple, since they are supposedly building their own car line. My questions are: will Audi stay up-to-date with Apple upgrades and changes, or move away?  And even if they stay with Apple or Android, can these new designs - Apple CarPlay and their GPS accept a software upgrade?   In regards to the new A4, I would recommend it.  The changes are enough to get me to the showroom. Hats off to the online marketing department.  In regard to price, it is pricer with all the new option stuff. In closing, I will probably buy one in June because my wife loves her A4, I love her, and it's time to trade up.

The 2015 Quattro A4 sedan fits me perfectly.  The 2015 styling is retro 2009 but has held its own over the intervening six years.  After comparing this sedan with the other two primary competitors, the BMW 3 series, and the Mercedes C class, I found the A4 standard features exceeded both.  Sure I could pay another four thousand dollars for a sun roof, leather seats and hands-free bluetooth but why when I could get these same features in the standard pkg?  The C-class had the best interior but the A4 tipped the scales over the BMW.  The ride comfort and road noise were subdued compared to the BMW but not as good as the Mercedes. After comparing the total acquisition cost, I would have paid another eight thousand dollars for the C300 with similar options.  I ended up adding Nav and heated seats to the other standard features to my A4.  I am very satisfied with my decision and look forward to every drive I take in timeless, efficient luxury.  The only regret I have is the car did not come with a smart key or backup camera --with all the other standard features, this is odd since they even came on my previous Camry.

It is a very good looking car and the interior is incredibly comfortable - with nice soft-touch materials.  Overall the car has been a positive experience and I would recommend it to anyone that asks.I only have two minor negatives about this vehicle - neither a reason not to purchase it:  1) The fact that it did not come with Bluetooth streaming unless you upgraded to the Prestige trim with the navigation system - a $4,000 upgrade for something that every Kia seems to come with by default.  2) I have had either indifferent or negative experiences every time I go to the Audi dealer (Plano, TX) for service - this has made it incredibly unlikely that I will ever purchase another Audi.

The car does not drive as smoothly now but at least I have not gotten any bubbles in the tires or cracked any rims since purchasing the continentals. There have been multiple recalls for the heating system, air bags, electronic, etc. that have required repairs.

Then, at 41,000 the car DIED on the highway due to transmission failure. I had to have the vehicle towed in the middle of the night to the dealership. The ENTIRE transmission needs to be replaced.

The 2.0 turbo also bangs constantly at low speeds and if your try to accelerate fast all you get is a pedal of air.

Overall it is a great vehicle, comfortable, engine response is prompt, transmission is flawless, ride is quiet, steering is sharp. For negatives I would note the complexity and lack of intuitiveness of the infotainment system, using their GPS was taking too long to set on a destination and I kept using my TomTom. I guess it takes time to learn how to use it, same with toggling with the map display in the central area between the speed and tachometer. Also at low speeds the brake looses linearity and suddenly locks the wheels if you press a little harder. Also getting in and out of the car is a bit uncomfortable.

It stickered just shy of the $50k mark. If I wasn't able to get a smoking deal on it I would have never bought it. Sure, it's pretty. Sure, people go ""ooohhh, you have an Audi"" but honestly, this car is nowhere near worth the price of entry. For $15k less you can get a fully loaded Passat with the 1.8t which is all anyone really needs. You will wind up with a much bigger, more comfortable car. With darn near the same build quality, and it will have everything a modern car should have. For example...Bluetooth streaming audio. The Audi doesn't have it until you pony up for the premium plus package. Which pushes you over that 50k mark. Another place the A4 falls woefully short is the back seat. If you have kids in booster seats, get ready to wrestle with seatbelts because the seat area is so narrow your booster WILL block the buckle. And we have the Diono Cambria which is a fairly narrow booster. Still blocks the buckle. Also, if anyone riding up front is over 6' tall, you will render that back seat virtually useless. My 4 year old complains about being squished behind me, I'm 6'3"". We don't have the problem in our far less expensive, much more equipped Passat. Basically, if you are of average or lower stature, the A4 might be ok for you, as long as you're ok with paying a boatload of money for a car that has some seriously glaring omissions in the options department. If you want a well built German car that has everything in it and won't break the bank, go to VW and save some money.",3,2016," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M)"

I can't do this in the Audi unless I purchase the much more expensive package or plug my phone in.. to a cord... in the glove box. No. Just no. Also, CVT transmissions are crap and forced me into a more expensive Quattro to avoid them. Who doesn't want to feel the car shifting? Who likes CVT transmissions?!

The 2008 A4 had 28K miles from a warm-weather state and was a one-owner car from a vacation home - well cared for with full service records based on time, not mileage. I would have preferred Quattro, but the price and mileage were hard to beat. I should have listened to my instincts. Vastly different character than the A3... this A4 feels like a luxury car without any sporting pretense. The CVT transmission is horrendous - slow to respond in standard mode, jerky engagement from dead stop... in Sport mode, it holds RPMs far too long at low speeds before initially ""upshifting."" Engine vibration is far more apparent than it should be for any luxury vehicle - the same engine in the A3 was less prone to vibration. Brakes on the A4 are less direct, more difficult to modulate and with longer pedal travel than the A3 - might be fixed with stainless steel brake lines. Steering is much lighter and less dynamic as well; same with the suspension which is calibrated for a compliant, soft ride over handling - lacking the balance of a BMW 3-series. Lastly, the climate control is noticeably less accurate than the A3... the interior temp seems to be about 5 degrees higher than the set point during all seasons. Might be a faulty part or just the nature of the system - hard to tell and not worth tearing apart the climate controls to find out. On the good side, the car is indeed comfortable as a highway cruiser. The interior materials are top notch. The trunk seriously swallows more cargo than my wife's Ford Escape. Instruments are legible and direct. For the price paid, the car came well optioned for a 2008 model - although bewildering that certain features now standard on mid-level cars (like heated seats, Bluetooth and USB/AUX inputs) were nowhere to be found on my A4. It's a handsome car that will serve as a good family hauler for a couple of years - a car that I wouldn't be ashamed to take clients between point A and B. Lesson learned though - it's not a driver's car in the same way a 3-series might be. No major mechanical issues so far (knock on wood)... replaced post-purchase: an A/C diverter valve, the engine thermostat and the window lock switch. Not bad for a mid-2000s Audi. Overall, I'm not sure I would buy the A4 in this configuration again... at this price point for a used vehicle, there are more competent sport sedans and more reliable family sedans that cost less to operate.",3,2008," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Special Ed. 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo CVT)"

I purchased this car used with 47,000 on it.  The first month I had the car I accidently leaned on the lid for the center console storage.  The cheap plastic hinge snapped off and Audi wants $280 for a replacement.  The tire sensors' battery went dead and you cannot replace the battery...I think the Audi sensor was $125 (?).  I went with a generic at the tire dealer for less than half that. My air conditioning compressor failed at the beginning of the summer.  A replacement is available online for around $300, but in order to get to it you literally have to take the front of the car off and support the engine with a jack.  Most mechanics understandably want $1,300-$1,500 for that one.  At the moment, I have an error code that indicates my high-pressure fuel pump is failing.  It is a too common problem with these 2.0 Turbo engines that may be related to a cam follower on the pump.   The story is that during a great demand for these cars a few years ago Audi contracted a new supplier to make these parts, which were made of sub-standard metal.  In extreme cases, these parts disintegrate and the metal shavings can cause catostrophic engine failure.  Audi is resisting  the making a general recall.

He was entirely sympathetic, helpful, and professional and forwarded my case to the Regional Rep for Audi.   I doubted, however, that I would get any assistance from Audi, but I was only hoping that maybe they would stand behind their product.  I am delighted to report that Audi America has agreed to replace my second engine at no cost to me after I presented my cars service history to them.

I was extremely happy with the car - especially the acceleration and road handling. The first week of August 2016, with 47,000 miles on the car - the check engine light goes on and some unholy sounds begin emitting from the engine block. After two mechanics, I was directed to bring the car back to the dealer. After a day and a half, the verdict - motor and turbo are done. The dealer informed me that the motor/turbo parts were a mere $14,000! If I wanted to trade the car in, they would give me $500. Currently, the car is in a mechanic's shop in Brooklyn - it looks like the repairs, parts, labor will be around $11,000. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had a Toyota Camry for 15 years and never once had to make a repair of that cost and magnitude. Or maybe I would be better off with a Hyundai.February 2017: Ended up paying $12,700 for a new motor, turbo and alternator from my friends mechanic in Brooklyn. Had contacted Audi and a personal service representative informed me that they would only pick up the costs if I had the car repaired at an Audi dealer. Spoke to a Vice President of Audi who directed me to their service website. I filled out a long, detailed questionnaire and NEVER received a response. My 2009 Audi A4 Turbo is running better than it did before these repairs. I have every intention of using the car through the end of the NY winter and then trading it in for a Lexus, Acura, or a Volvo. I've spoken with many mechanics who have agreed that it is near impossible for them to work on an Audi. Obviously, I will tell anyone to avoid the 2009 Audi A4 and the whole line of vehicles. The Audi representatives exhibited complete indifference to my problems with a 2009 line of vehicles that had a detailed history of inferior manufacturing problems.Additional: I traded in the Audi A4 for a pre owned 2014 Lexus GS350 AWD during March of 2017 that had 24,000 miles. I am extremely happy with the performance of the Lexus and the service received from the dealer - Ray Catena Lexus of White Plains. One final telling indication regarding the 2009 Audi A4 Turbo- it routinely appears as a Used Car to avoid in Consumer Reports annual car ratings. I'm aware that Audi manufactures several high quality vehicles but would not recommend an Audi based on my experience with the vehicle I owned.

The Audi A4 was hands down the worst car I have ever owned. I bought the car with 40,000 miles on it. It was beautiful and drove great. As the 60,000 mile mark started to tick on the odometer, it started to fall apart. Every 1,000 miles the oil light would come on. I would take it in and the dealer said ""add a quart of oil!"" Thank you but is my car burning that much oil that I need to add a quart every 1000 miles or less? They offered to replace the turbos that ""might"" be the problem... Then the transmission problems started in. A very loud ""clunk"" every time you hit the gas pedal from a stop. Back to the dealer, ""past the warranty, 7,000$, sorry, dont know what to tell you.""  Apparently the transmission slips into neutral when you stop and then clunks into  ""gear"" (CVT transmission)  when you hit the gas. It sounded and felt like the transmission was falling out everytime you stopped at a stop sign. It was embarrassing. It had to be driven like a manual and ease it in. Then the interior rattles started. It sounded like something was loose in the doors, every door. The kicker was when I started dating a girl that drove a 1 year newer Jetta. It was THE EXACT SAME CAR with the same features for way less money. She opted for the manual transmission so no tranny problems for her.The good things about the car is that it has comfortable seats and the interior design is comfortable, although, coating on the plastic will start peeling off so your interior will look 10 years old after 5 years.I had enough and traded it in. After 2 years of ownership I realized I could have bought a new car for cash with all the repairs and losses. The first thing the dealer asked when I traded it in and before he looked at the car was ""Let me guess, Tranny or electrical?"" Sums it up right there...",1,2009," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo CVT)"

In the month I've had it, it's delivered everything it promised, and a lot more.  Can't say enough good things about this car.  Handles wonderfully, no matter what mode it's in.  I prefer sports mode because it suits my driving style best, but ordinary Drive mode is nice when just cruising on the freeway and getting 30+mpg.  I'm averaging 29 miles per gallon, city and freeway, much better than expected and far exceeding what my V6 Honda ever got, even with cylinder deactivation.  Accelerates very smoothly, just a hint of a pause and then it kind of ""jumps "" off the line and up to speed seemingly instantly.  Feels much faster than what is written, and probably is. Definitely under 6 seconds to 60mph, but that's not what they say.  Very happy with the transission and wouldn't have got the car with a CVT, so it was a Quattro or a different make.  A bit hard to find in my targeted budget range, with the trim and color I wanted, but persistence, hard work, and determination paid off....and the willingness to travel over a hundred miles.  Kudos to Circle Audi of Long Beach for sending me a Uber ride to get there, and treating me well at the dealer.  No ""over the top"" selling with these guys, straight to the point and excellent product knowledge, what's you definitely want in a salesperson.  I laid out my specs to them, they found me the perfect car right away and got me the kind of deal I was happy with.  Such a great deal I don't want to say what it is, and it's a certified pre-owned Audi with some warranty, always a plus with a used car.  Thought I would miss my old car, and I do a little, but I've found a new love and her name is Audi Quattro. I'm hooked and as long as maintainance is low and the car remains dependable, I'll be in Audis for the foreseeable future.  All the car reviews of this car were spot on, and maybe even a little underwhelming for this car.  I can't really say anything negative about any aspect of the vehicle, only that the steering is a bit too soft at times and combine that ease of steering with how well the car moves and you have to be very careful not to change lanes by mistake because you turned your writ a half centimeter...it's that precise and easy to turn.  Sport mode firms it up a bit, but still very effortless and I like more of a road feel in my hands.  I like to drive, not be driven by my car. This car has both available, which is nice.  Electronics were simple to learn, navigation is so precise it's scary, and nothing feels cheap and not corners seem cut, to save a few bucks and annoy the consumer.  I'm a big fan of companies wh ""tighten all the bolts"" and aren't lazy, and cheap, about quality.  Nothing rattles, and exterior noise is virtually eliminated.  Engine has a nice little growl to it that's not over the top, but just loud enough to tell you that it's no ordinary 4 cylinder under the hood.  No sound of the turbo at all, which is really amazing, you really don't know it's there until the toque really kicks in and speed jumps up pretty fast.  I have to really pay attention, or I may be getting speeding tickets because you definitely don't feel the high speed, and 65 doesn't feel all that different from 100....not that I've ever gone that fast, but to illustrate....

"1978",2016-09-07,"Leigh","2014 Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M)","So much fun to drive!!","I purchased a used 2014 Audi A4 premium plus quatro about a month ago.  So far, I love it!  I specifically wanted a manual transmission, because I just love shifting gears.  This car is a blast to drive and shift!  I previously owned a VW Passat, which I was pleased with, but have really enjoyed a slight ""step up"" to the Audi.  The car handles very well, I love the side assist (blinking lights when someone is in your blind spot and your blinker is on), the auto-sensing wipers (never have to touch the wiper level!!), and the overall feel of the car.  It is very ""sturdy"" and quiet.  My Passat was really noisy, so this was a great change.  I also love the push-button start and the push-button parking brake (no more difficult parking brake to wrestle with!)  My VW had the old-fashioned remote key lock and unlock, and I love that with my Audi, I just have to reach for the handle - as long as the key is in my purse, the car will unlock for me.  No more searching for my keys in the bottom of my purse!!!!!  Now for the disappointments: first, even though I have the premium plus, there is no back-up camera.  I knew this before I bought, but was told by the salesman that I could easily add one from Best Buy for about $250.  I looked into it (before purchasing the car), and it looked like he was right.  However, when I went to BB to get the back-up camera, I found out that these after-market accessories cannot be added to a factory-installed monitor without a VERY expensive adapter (like, over $1,000)!  So... now I have to live without a back-up camera.  I also don't like the radio selection on the steering column.  Instead of just pushing a button to move from one preset station to the next (like in my VW), you have to roll a little knob to select the station, and then push the button.  It's almost impossible to do this without looking at the dashboard.  It takes my eyes and attention off the road.  Also, I'm disappointed in the bluetooth voice command.  In my VW, my phone book contacts from my phone were automatically recognized by my car.  All I had to say was, call Samantha Anderson (or any contact in my phone's contact list), and it dialed the number.  With the Audi, I have to actually pre-record a voice tag for Samantha Anderson and input her number, or it won't recognize and call.  I was really shocked by these downgrades.  The Audi is supposed to be a step up, and it is in most ways, but definitely some technology oversights that are surprising.  Some other features that are very important to me: a very big trunk and seats that fold down (very easy to maneuver), seat memory, seat heat, and a rockin' sound system!!  Although there are a few technological features that I would change, I LOVE the A4!!!!",5,2014," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M)"

In the meantime I also acquired a BMW M235i, which I love, but that only completes my car ownership experience between the two cars. Audi is still the more comfortable and the go to car for any longer family trip. The BMW is the car to be in when alone and on shorter trips. The Audi is for family trips and for when I'm getting tired of the firmer BMW ride. Audi has a great suspension, firm enough to have an adequate attitude, but soft enough to be comfortable in most conditions. With good winter tires Audi is unbeatable in snow and ice. You don't get the thrills of the BMW acceleration, and precise handling, but you don't need that most of the time, and what you get in the Audi is plenty adequate for a very decent price. I also love the Quattro Torsen implementation. I just can't understand why Audi is messing up with such a great system for the more complex and likely less reliable Haldex in the newer designs.

I was envious of the 2017 A4's engine output and torque figures. I mentioned it to the tech and while having the car serviced. He said, ""Just chip it!"" So, I did. In July of 2017 with 88,800 miles on the car, I went with the Stage 1 ECU upgrade from APR (goapr.com). The power improvement is immediately noticeable, and it's addictive. Once you get used to the improved performance it's not easy going back to the stock configuration. Just to be cautious I do revert to 'normal' engine mode every so often. The 'chip' has 4 modes: 93 Octane; 91 Octane; Valet [which restricts speed to 30 MPH] and Normal or Stock. My fuel efficiency has decreased as expected, but it actually improves when I run on cruise control for long distances.  I cannot accurately note the loss of efficiency because I went from Pirelli P7 Cinturato Low Rolling Resistance tires to Michelins Pilot Sport A/S 3+. Before having the chip installed I noticed a decrease in fuel efficiency with the change in tires. I'm still loving this car. A friend of mine, who happens to be an executive with Enterprise Holdings and is always driving the latest and greatest that the company has to offer, get's in and says, ""Ya know, I like this car!"" And believe me, this friend is NOT free and easy with compliments. I have 102,000 miles on the car. I am meticulous about maintenance and Keeping the car clean and shiny.  I was honestly looking at another Audi, but realized I'm gonna entire soon and will most likely keep this one as long as I can.  Still Enjoy This Automobile!My original review, made shortly after purchase follows this updated review.  I have owned the 2014 Premium Plus version of Audi's A4 for 30 months and 76,000 miles.  I still Love this car! I learned  of an issue with deposits accumulating on the intake valves of direct injected turbocharged engines.  I learned of some measures to reduce this accumulation and so far so good.  Performance remains consistent i.e. very much the same as when I first began driving the car.  I do my own oil changes at 5K mile intervals. I did notice that the HVAC unit seems to blow cold air when I wanted heat.  I mentioned this when I a had the car serviced. The technician assured me that all was as it should be. At my last service there was an update to the programming of the HVAc unit addressing the issue that I had identified earlier. The dual zone climate control now works as prescribed.   We looked at the new A4 but, in terms of styling, it seems dull compared to the 2014 (B8). Tires and wheels have been an issue as having never had blowout nor wheel damage I never anticipated a need for a wheel and tire warranty.  With the 18"" wheels, I purchased a new set of tires in six months. I've also had to have 3 wheels straightened at that place in Bath PA. Glad they're close by. I'm headed there again at the end of this month. Other than that there have been no issues. The car still gets nods and 'nice car' comments. And most of all, ""I STILL THOROUGHLY ENJOY DRIVING THIS CAR!!! Still feels good every time I get in. Color me 'Happy'! Here's my original review:Just purchased a 2014 A4. The driving dynamics are amazing and better than the new BMW's. I have driven performance cars all my life and the handling of this car is sublime. The styling is subtle and elegant. The engine lacks the sonorous qualities of more performance oriented vehicles but given the plebeian power figures the car moves with an alacrity and agility that genuinely impresses; credit the 8 speed Steptronic transmission. Steering, while a bit numb is direct and precise. That's all I need from a sedan. Amenities abound and present themselves when you least expect them. It's like an Armani suit, the closer you look at the details the more beautiful touches you find. The A4 IMHO blends Power Elegance and Beauty like few automobiles ever have. Love this car!!!OKAY! Here we are at 86,600 miles....and I'm still in love with my A4. Nothing much has changed at all. I have had no issues with the mechanics of the car and she still turns heads and gets the occasional envious glance if not an outright thumbs up.  I purchased a new set of Michelins as opposed to the OEM Pirelli's, which featured low rolling resistance.  I notice an increase in fuel consumption. of about 2 or 3 MPG.  But the Michelins feel softer and offer more feedback and about the same grip.",5,2014," Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A)"

This one is my first, although it is used.  A mint condition 2011 with 41k miles bought in early 2016.I REALLY debated over getting rid of my Ram pick-up, paid off mind you, for a few years of monthly payments.  The monthly payments are well within my comfort zone, so I'm not crying poor mouth, but I'm the frugal type and view the payments as opportunity cost.As with any car purchase...........do your homework.  As previously mentioned, years 2009 through 2011 are known for oil consumption issues (turbo engines only).  This alone caused me severe pause.  Not only did I go over the Carfax (work related to fixing this issue will be there if done by a reputable dealer) with a fine tooth comb, I actually called the shop, also on the Carfax, where my vehicle received all of it's milestone check-ups and spoke to the service people.  They were kind enough to review the service history of my vehicle with me.  My Audi has never been in for oil consumption problems.  The service person told me that it was unlikely that I'd experience this given the mileage......it should have popped up by now.   I also called Audi of America and confirmed that Audi has agreed to cover all repairs related to the oil consumption issue for 8 years or 80,000 miles.  Whichever comes first.  So with that final nugget of information I took the plunge.The car rides wonderfully and is extremely comfortable.  It took a while to get used to all of the buttons and gizmos (my A4 is a loaded premium package) but I feel so spoiled now when driving.I absolutely love the AWD (Quattro) but have noticed understeer when hitting a corner a little too hot.

I regularly (read always) listen to an AM talk-radio station. Once in a while - it seems to correspond to cold wet weather - the sound flops from low to high volume. The amount of flop seems to correspond to the settings that specify how much the radio sound is turned down when the parking sensors are doing their job. But the parking sensors are not on and it only weirds out on the one station; others play just fine. I guess as long as you don't listen to talk radio, this is not an issue.

Seeing as this was my personal 'to and from the office' car, I didn't go crazy with options, opting for just a handful: performance package (primarily for the shocks and sweet looking wheels), the driver comfort package (Homelink being the big one there) and the Driver Assistance package (camera/back-up sensors etc.)First off... the car's a hoot to drive. Setting the exhaust to dynamic makes the most of the engine, and makes it sound considerably sportier. The engine is responsive and the engine doesn't lack for power. I do suspect that my car is an underachiever in terms of horses - I'm not getting close to sub-5 second sprints to 60. This could also be because my engine only has 3K on it. The car handles extremely well - feels as well planted as anything I've ever owned - including my e92 335i coupe.The largest disappointment for me is the gearbox. I find that there's .5 seconds of lag between input and response - this isn't turbo lag per se, this is the gearbox being slow in response to the input. This happens across the rev range. (even in launch control mode) Audi really needs to look at the software and possibly tweak it. I know that other aftermarket parts suppliers have also noticed this and addressed it through add-ons. I also think that Audi should give this thing more than 6 forward speeds. I think that a 7 or 8 speed DSG would further help with performance and also improve highway mileage.Interior-wise, the cabin is stylish. I like the two tone seats in mine. I went for the black/grey leather combination - I find the black/red a little too garish for my taste. On the whole, I like the interior - although, a little more storage space would be welcome. The plastics on certain areas feel a little cheap. Back seat leg space is sufficient for my kids - think adults could be a little cramped over long distances.As a whole, I'm very happy with my car - and look forward to driving it.

So far, I am amazed literally every time I drive it. Full disclosure: this is my fifth Audi in 30 years, so I am definitely a fan. The S3 is an incredible amalgam of power, speed, comfort, features and appearance. It includes Homelink (garage door opener), manual sport seats (Recaro quality), nav system, and a ""jukebox"" (hard drive) that will hold up to 3,000 songs. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is great, so I rip my .mp3s at their highest resolution. The sales staff even made an after-delivery tutorial session where we set up the car's parameters. Switchable magnetic suspension, multiple drive and shift modes. Shocks Corvette and Mustang drivers! 4wd!!! After 18 mos, this car is still incredlbly fast and agile. Yet it can be driven in 'granny mode' very comfortably. A good radar dedector is helpful, as simple passing maneuver acceleration can put the car at 85-90 with no conscious effort. Takes gentle mountain curves at 110 with ease and a remarkable lack of drama, making a pleasant Sunday drive into take-me-to-jail territory.

However we needed AWD, fast (300ish hp), high quality, cargo space, fun, cool looking, DSG type auto transmission car.  Audi is the only one building that and it's the S3.  Considered S4 but MPG too low; Golf R has too little cargo room but nice car. S3 combines amazing refinement, quiet ride, taut but comfortable euro sedan ride, throaty exhaust when punched, great looks, good MPG, driver assistance that can be shut off, & much more.  The 2015 S3 is dual personality and you decide which one you want: rip roaring sports car or a easy driving luxurious touring sedan.  Amazing.Update 11/2017:   Still love this car and will never sell it.  It draws many compliments and I never seem to see that many S3s running around.  I like this 2015 styling better than the ""update.""  The update has more ""check mark"" style of headlights which I do not prefer.  I ran the S3 at the track and it was 100ºF that day.  With Nitto NT05 tires it performed well but wasn't scary fast; cornered very well however.  For me though it's not a track car but a perfect street car.  298hp Is adequate (and I'd like more).  But the S-Tronic transmission is the win in the S3: it uses the power very efficiently and you'll be able to beat a lot of cars that should be faster (I know b. I've done it).  Interior is amazing still, very comfortable and upscale showing very little wear with the high class materials.  No reliability problems whatsoever have cropped up although my car is fairly low miles.  MPG is around 25 which is amazing for an AWD sports car with this power.  When the warranty wears out I will put a Stage 2 APR chip in it to easy and safely unlock more power.  Guys who've bought the RS3 say the cars run about the same until you hammer the RS3 which on public roads is ill advised.  Anyway, I'd buy this car all over again and I don't say anything out there that I like better.

Just to correct one thing, it does have a USB port in the console under the armrest right next to the Audi connect port. For perspective, I've owned several BMW's including 3 and 5 series, a Z4 3.0 and a slew of Benzes ranging from S-Class and G-Wagen to SLK and CLK430 and currently a mint CLS500. Two cars before this purchase, I owned a Porsche Cayman S for 4 years.  I've autocrossed, done track days and been a sports car fan since the late 50's when I first saw Jim Kimberly in his Ferrari win a race.  Enough history.  I shopped the M235i and MB GLA45 AMG before making this buy. The S3 is a true entry level luxury rocket. It has all the tech anyone could want (and probably never use). Mine is a Prestige and has all the Driver's assistance goodies, e.g. adaptive cruise, lane assist, blind spot monitoring, Presense braking, etc. These things are truly workable and disconnectable, great for interstate cruising. Now there is also Launch Control, along with 4 driving modes.  The sound when in Dynamic, or S drive is among the best I've heard.  And did I mention this thing really does fly. Audi says 0-60 in 4.7 sec. Motor Trend, C&D say 4.4 sec. One does have to know how to make it launch but it can be done in several ways only has one ""must"" step, disable the traction control. Shift to ""S""or manual, disable the TC, step on the brake and floor the gas. It winds up to 4,000rpm. Take your foot off the brake and hold on.  The sports seat are very comfortable but lack electric adjustment! Don't select the sports seats and you get electric. This isn't a big issue unless a number of different drivers will use the car. Not a problem for me.  One other lux feature missing but available if ordered at the port is Homelink. It's not on the option list but ask if it is a must have and it can be installed.  The B&O audio is terrific and entertainment sound options are numerous, Sirius, two of your own SD cards, BT stream through your phone or iPad, and it all works easily, automatically once you hook it up. The MMI system is as noted by many auto mags, easy to use and a really nice interface. On a closing note, neither the BMW or Benz interiors are nearly as nice and they don't have all of Audi's tech either... and comparably equipped (to the extent possible) they will cost $5-8,000 more.  Check their depreciation vs Audi's 53% after 5 years.  In summary, if you're in the market for a small luxury road rocket, you must give this car a look. As an update, I've now taken several road trips and have 8200+ miles on the odometer. The car continues to perform brilliantly with my only gripe being the inability to receive text messages unless iMessage is disabled and Twitter responses being very limited.

Handling and agility are tight and inspire confidence.  Acceleration is great, especially for the size of the engine; after taking it out for a spin, it took some effort to convince my friends and family that it was only a four-cylinder engine.  Shifting into higher gear at high revs sounds great, but engine noise when daily driving is calm and unobtrusive.The size is great for an urban area when you still want to fit people in the backseat - I'm 5'11"" and would be just fine sitting in the back on a decent road trip, though the back is not super roomy.  I prefer the smaller wheelbase over the BMW, as it only adds to the zippy feel of the car.  I compared the Golf R and the BMW M235, and was most impressed and got the best deal by far with the S3.  A must is the performance package (either the standard or the black optic) - the magnetic suspension is taut when on smooth freeways but welcomingly smooth when avoiding potholes in the city.

I didn't expect to enjoy it this much, but I do. I am coming from driving a 2012 E93 BMW M3 convertible, which was an excellent car in its own right. I expected to like the S3 after test driving it, but I could never imagine that I will like driving it more than the M3. Where the M3 felt powerful and fast the S3 feels quick and nimble. It is difficult to explain, but for me, driving the S3 is more relaxing and more controlled at the same time. M3 had better steering and better breaks even though S3's steering and breaks are excellent too. I like the power delivery of the S3 better. In S mode there is no turbo/transmission lag and D mode is OK for everyday driving. Magnetic/Active damping makes the car more comfortable, it is stiff, but not nearly as harsh as the M3 was.One thing I haven't figured out and having a slight trouble with is the Bluetooth connection. I am using it with Nexus 6P and streaming music gets muted very shortly after the car starts and Bluetooth gets connected. The music is still streamed but sound is not coming through the car or the phone. I need to turn off Bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to fix it. After that all is well.

To be fair, however, if I was thinking about purchasing a new S3 today, I'd probably wait and compare it to the upcoming RS3 first, which my local Audi dealer has told me is due to arrive in November. That said, if it's in as short supply as the BMW M2 continues to be - and negotiating any sort of discount off of MSRP would be unlikely - I'd likely stick with the S3, assuming I could successfully negotiate as strong a discount as last time around.Also, to correct an earlier remark I made about the car: its HomeLink system is apparently dealer-installed, and in my case it wasn't listed separately on my invoice, for some reason (despite being charged extra for the dealer-installed tinted windows). Finally, just to note the one feature my car doesn't have that I wish it did: memory-stored seat and steering wheel positions. Considering my 2003 BMW had them, as do numerous vehicles priced less than even a base-level S3, this seems like an admittedly unusual instance of Audi cutting corners.Updated review: 3/12/17Still couldn't be happier with it! It's still quite literally in a class of its own: it's better than the CLA 45 despite being $15K cheaper, and BMW's smallest sedan is a size up from the A3/S3 (comparable to an A4). Yes, it has most of the same underpinnings as the VW Golf R (minus the magnetic suspension, which is absolutely a must-have item), but VW still has the lingering question of how badly Dieselgate will ultimately impact resale values.Updated review: 9/10/16It's now been four months since I bought my S3, and I remained as enamored with it as ever. Really, the *only* issue I have with the car is that it takes the A/C a while to get going, though note that I live in Texas and have to park it outside all day while at work. Still, the cold blast doesn't kick in until about 15-20 seconds after I start it, or at least it does when the temp's 95+ (which in my part of Texas is nearly every day between June and September). I also wanted to comment on remarks made in a few reviews posted since I wrote my original one. I've also had some curious issues with its Bluetooth system and my Nexus 6P phone, but much different ones than ""Barmoley"" apparently had. Rather than streaming music getting automatically muted, I've found that the car's Bluetooth system automatically activates the last music app I used even if I DON'T want to listen to music (and don't have *any* music apps open on my phone). The problem's not limited to either that one phone or merely Android phones; I also have an iPhone, and the *exact* same thing happens with it as well. In both cases the only way to prevent it is to turn off the phones' Bluetooth connection altogether. That said, I've never had any problems listening to either Google Maps or Waze navigation directions through the stereo. Finally, I wanted to correct one error in Jim Glass's otherwise-excellent review: the S3 does include HomeLink, and I'm pretty sure it's standard equipment. It's located in a slightly odd spot -- to the right of the driver-side visor, facing the left *window* -- but it's definitely there and has three programmable buttons.Original review: 5/20/16As a longtime BMW aficionado, I had some doubts at first about switching my allegiance over to Audi, but after owning my S3 for a while, I have ZERO regrets. While BMW seems to have lost its way in recent years -- at least in terms of offering vehicles that truly *connect* with the road -- Audi has gone the opposite route, upping its game with its S-series of cars as BMWs have gotten increasingly bloated (in terms of price *and* literal bloat, as in curb weight). The S3 is a pocket rocket in the truest sense of the term, with razor-sharp handling and incredibly quick acceleration for a four-cylinder vehicle. BMW doesn't even *make* a comparable vehicle; its closest competitor is the M2, which is only available as a (fairly impractical) coupe. The Benz CLA 45 is the S3's only direct competition, and I found it to be subpar in nearly every way, most of all in terms of price: while I managed to negotiate a final purchase price of under $40K for my vehicle -- and that's *with* a number of options, notably the Black Optic performance package -- most of the CLAs I saw had sticker prices north of $60K! (Much like BMW, Benz goes way overboard with its options pricing.) Even a Benz C450 AMG is difficult to procure for much under $50K (and a C63 obviously costs far more.)Furthermore, the S3 is the only one of the bunch that offers a measure of practicality to go with its sportiness. Good luck trying to fit anyone over 5'10"" or so in the back seat of a CLA; its roofline severely constricts rear head room. It has a surprisingly commodious trunk, with seats that fold down *far* more easily than those in any BMW I've ever owned. To be fair, rear leg room isn't great, but it's certainly better than that in a BMW 2-series (and only slightly less than that in a 3-series).",5,2016," Audi S3 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM)"

I have also owned a Porsche Cayman S in the recent past, and the Audi is superior to that car in nearly every respect. Any prospective Cayman buyer should give the Audi serious consideration. However, after six months of ownership, the check engine light came on. Due to the rarity of the vehicle and its sophisticated engine, it took two weeks for my dealer to find and fix the problem.

The new IE8888 2.0 liter turbo four cylinder works beautifully with the S-tronic transmission (the only one available in the U.S.). There is just a bit of turbo lag below 2500 rpm, but once in the boost power is of no concern at all. The acceleration is more than enough for the average driver, and at freeway speeds even the base TT passes other cars with ease (but be sure to let the S-tronic downshift a couple gears first). With Audi's Quattro system, grip in poor conditions is not a problem if you're being reasonable (note: I live in a very snowy area of the U.S.) but I have gotten it to intentionally slide at low speeds. In dry conditions you'd have to be quite reckless to get this thing to lose grip, but it is manageable when the rear steps out of line. It handles well, but, (and this is a critique of all Audis I've experienced) the steering is pretty numb and doesn't provide much in the way of feedback on the road surface. The steering is, however, well weighted and is direct enough that I barely even need to think about where I want the car to go. The suspension is on the firmer side but it isn't harsh or jarring at all on decent road surfaces, body roll through corners is negligible and the chassis feels rock solid. Fuel economy is also better than advertised in my car, at freeway speeds I have achieved 29 mpg (US cycle) when I was told I should be getting 27.5 mpg or less(Technology) The Virtual Cockpit is undoubtedly the star of the Interior. It does take some time to get used to controlling almost  everything through the steering wheel, but once acclimated it is quite intuitive and easy to use, even on the move. Safety isn't too much of a concern since the system is mounted very close to eye level (also of note I'm only 5'8"" or 172 cm) but don't be too distracted by it. Also, the screen provides a good enough viewing angle to allow a passenger to use the entertainment system without struggle, but they can change the layout of the guages if they go into a submenu. The one critique that I have for the Virtual Cockpit is that the control buttons are somewhat small even with my diminutive hands and I could easily see somebody with larger or gloved hands struggle with the steering wheel mounted controls. This is remedied with a more conventional MMI control set up intended mostly for passengers, but it is somewhat disappointing given that it's a selling point of this car. I also have the technology package and B&O sound system, the first out of necessity and the later out of desire. The parking sensors and rearview camera are a must for this car as judging distances can be somewhat tough. The blind spot monitor is also a must have option because the C-pillar is simply massive and obtrusive in everyday driving. I could foresee an instance where a driver cannot see a motorcyclist behind them due to the size of the C-pillar, and backing out of parking spaced makes me nervous. My only real complaint about the technology is that active cruise control or front collision prevention isn't even offered. Of note, I believe this is offered in Europe but not North America for some reason. (Interior) Audi is known for their excellent interiors and this is no exception. I opted for the sports seats and the leather quality is superb, as is the comfort they provide. It is quite easy to make a long journey in this car without being fatigued or uncomfortable. The dashboard is made of a pretty high quality soft touch material that lends itself well to the aesthetic of the rest of the interior. The vent mounted HVAC controls are also pretty intuitive and in my opinion look stylish and futuristic. As for the rear seats, they really are an afterthought. They are basically reserved for children and the most petite of adults, although I have gotten people of 5'5"" in the back for short periods, but they did complain about the space. In my experience they serve better as an extra storage space but they do have child seat mounts. One additional note, ingress and egress are difficult in this car not only by the long doors typical of coupes, but also by the wider side skirts and fairly wide door sill. Overall the interior is a great place to be as long as you do not plan on having more than one other passenger for long periods of time. (Storage) Despite its small size the TT actually impresses in the amount of storage it offers. There are numerous small cubbies in the main cabin and the trunk is surprisingly large, particularly when the seats are folded down. There is also a full size spare tire too(conclusion) This is a fun small high tech sports car that one can easily live with every day and enjoy. If you live in a colder climate and can justify having microscopic rear seats, this is a great all-weather sports coupe",4,2016," Audi TTS Coupe quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM)"
